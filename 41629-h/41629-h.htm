<h3>BY JACOB ABBOTT.</h3>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<h3>I. THE SNOW-SHOES.</h3>

<p class="drop">As soon as Martha had gone, Ellen began to make such preparations as she
thought necessary for the night. She placed the furniture of the room in
order. She brought in some wood from the back room and laid it down very
gently by the side of the fire, so as to have a sufficient supply of
fuel at hand. She also brought the water pail and put it under the seat
of the settle, in order that the water might not freeze, and by means of
a long-handled tin dipper she filled the tea kettle full, in order that
there might be an ample supply of hot water, should any occasion occur
requiring any. She then brought a small blanket and held it to the fire,
and when it was very thoroughly warm, she put it very gently under the
counterpane, around her aunt's feet, fearing that her feet might be
cold. In fact they were very cold. Ellen extinguished the lamp, too, and
put it away upon her table near the window, lest the light of it should
shine upon her aunt's eyes and disturb her sleep. The light of the fire
was sufficient to illuminate the room. The light of the fire, too,
seemed more cheerful to Ellen than that of the lamp. It flashed brightly
upon the walls and ceiling, and diffused a broad and genial glow all
over the floor.</p>

<p>Ellen made all these arrangements in the most quiet and noiseless manner
possible. During all the time her aunt lay silent and motionless, as if
in a profound slumber.</p>

<p>After Ellen had extinguished the lamp, she paused a moment, looking
around the room to see if there was any thing which she had forgotten.
She could not think of any thing else to do, and so she concluded to sit
down and watch by her aunt until Martha should return.</p>

<p>She took a cushion from a great rocking chair which stood in a corner of
the room, and put it down upon the bear skin rug. She then sat down upon
the cushion and laid her head upon the pillow by the side of her aunt.
She then gently took her aunt's hand and laid it upon her cheek, in the
position in which her aunt herself had placed it, when Ellen had laid
her head down there before. She looked timidly into her aunt's face as
she did this, to see whether any signs that she was awake could be
observed. The eyes of the patient opened a very little, and a faint
smile lighted up her pale features for a moment, and Ellen thought that
she could perceive a gentle pressure upon her cheek from her aunt's
hand. In a moment, however, both the hand and the face returned to their
state of repose, as before.</p>

<p>Ellen remained quiet in this position a few minutes, looking into the
fire, and wondering when Martha would come back, when she felt something
gently touching her upon the shoulder. She looked round and found that
it was Lutie climbing up upon her. Lutie had jumped up from the floor to
the couch, and had crept along to where Ellen was lying, and was now
cautiously stepping over upon her.</p>

<p>"Ah, Lutie," said she. "Is it you? It is time for you to go to bed."</p>

<p>Lutie's bed was out in the back room. There
was no door leading from the room where Ellen
was, directly into the back room. It was necessary
to go into a sort of entry first, and from this
entry into the back room by a separate door. All
this may be clearly understood by referring to
the plan.</p>

<p>It happened, however, that there was an old
window in the partition between the great room
and the back room. The reason why this window
was in the partition was this. The house
was first built without any back room, and then
the window on that side looked out upon the
yard. When at last the back room was built,
the window was rendered useless, but it was not
closed up. There was a curtain over it, and this
curtain was always left drawn. The back room
was used for storage of various things, and for
rough and heavy work on extraordinary occasions.</p>

<p>Lutie's bed was in a box in a corner of this
room. The place is marked L in the plan. The
bed was made of carpets and was very warm.
Lutie was always put out there every night at
nine o'clock. She was not allowed to remain at
the fireside all night, lest she should do some
damage to the various things which were placed
there on cold nights to keep them warm. Lutie
was accustomed to remain quietly in her bed
until Martha got up in the morning. She always
knew when Martha got up, however early it
might be, for she could see the glow of the fire
which Martha made, shining through the old
window in the partition between the rooms.
When Lutie saw this light she would go to the
window, jump up upon the sill outside, and mew
for Martha to let her in.</p>

<p>Although it was not yet nine o'clock, and
<a class="pagenum" id="page_578" title="pg 578"></a>
though Ellen would have liked Lutie's company as long as she remained
alone with her aunt, she thought she would put her out.</p>

<p>"I may fall asleep myself," said she, "and
then you will creep along upon Aunt Anne, and
disturb her. So you must go, Lutie."</p>

<p>She accordingly took up the kitten and carried
her out. When she opened the door into the
entry, she saw quite a little drift of snow, which
had blown in under the edge of the door from
the outer platform.</p>

<p>"Ah, it is a cold and stormy night," said she,
"but you must get into bed as soon as you can,
and get warm."</p>

<p>Ellen stopped a moment to listen to the sound
of the storm, as it howled and roared among the
trees of the forest, and then went back again to
her place at the fireside.</p>

<p>She moved her cushion and rug to the foot of
the couch, and then bringing a pillow from the
bedroom, she put it upon the couch, at the foot of
it, so that she could sit upon the cushion, and lay
her head upon her own pillow, without any danger
of incommoding or disturbing her aunt. She
then sat down and laid her head upon this pillow,
with her face toward the fire. She determined,
however, though she thus laid her head down,
not to go to sleep, but to keep awake, if she possibly
could, until Martha or Hugh should return.</p>

<p>She did go to sleep, however, notwithstanding
all her resolution. She was asleep in fifteen
minutes after she had laid her head down.</p>

<div class="figleft w50">

title="Ellen Asleep" />
<p class="center">ELLEN ASLEEP.</p>
</div>

<p>Lutie fell asleep too, very soon, in her bed in
the back room, and Ellen's aunt was asleep, so that
all were asleep. There was no one watching or
awake in all the house.</p>

<p>Ellen slept several hours. In the mean time
the wind and storm raged more and more violently
without, and the snow fell from the skies and
was driven along the ground faster and faster.
Great drifts formed upon the roofs and around
the chimneys; and below, the yards, the fences,
the woodpiles were all covered. Great banks of
snow were formed too, behind the house, in the
whirling eddy produced by the wind in turning
round the corner. One of these banks rose gradually
up against the windows on that side. At
ten o'clock the whole lower sash of each window
was covered; at half past ten the snow had risen
half way up the upper sash, and at eleven one
window was entirely concealed, while only a little
corner of the other was left, and even that was
fast disappearing. The bucket in the well was
filled, and the snow was banked up against the
sides of the curb, till at last the crest of the drift
began to curl over at the top, as if seeking to
bury up the well entirely. The fences were all
hidden from view, and a cart which had been left
standing in the corner of the yard, was so entirely
covered, that nothing remained but a white
and shapeless mound to mark the place where it
lay buried.</p>

<p>At last Ellen opened her eyes again. She was
at first frightened to find that she had been asleep.
She feared that some mischief might have happened,
while she had been insensible. The fire
had burned entirely down, and the room was
almost dark. Ellen threw on a small stick of
wood to make a little blaze, and by the light of
this blaze she looked at her aunt. She was lying,
she found, in the same posture as when Ellen
went to sleep. Ellen put her ear down to listen,
and found that her aunt was breathing&mdash;very
gently, indeed&mdash;but still breathing.</p>

<p>Ellen looked at the clock; for there was a
large clock standing in a corner of
the room. It was twelve.</p>

<p>"It is midnight," said Ellen; "I
did not think it was so late."</p>

<p>Ellen next put some large sticks
of wood upon the fire. The room,
she thought, was getting cold. The
wood was dry and it blazed up very
cheerfully and illuminated the whole
apartment with a very cheerful light.
Lutie saw the light shining through
the curtain, and she supposed that it
was morning, and that Martha had
built the fire. So she stretched her
paws and rubbed her face, and then
after listening a moment to the sound
of the storm, she stepped over the
side of the box where her bed was
made, walked to the window, leaped
up upon the window-sill, and mewed,
according to her usual custom, expecting
that Martha would come to
let her in.</p>

<p>Ellen went and opened the window for Lutie.
Then she went back again to the fire. She stood
at the fire a minute or two, and then went to
the front window of the room, to look out; she
wondered what could have become of Martha.
She listened at the window. The storm was
roaring dreadfully down the valley, but nothing
could be seen. The panes of glass were half
covered with the snow, which was banked up
upon the sash on the outside. Ellen concluded
<a class="pagenum" id="page_579" title="pg 579"></a>
that she would go to the door, where she thought
that perhaps she might see a little way down
the road, and if she could not see, at least she
could listen. So she put a shawl over her shoulders
and went out into the porch. She shut
the door leading from the porch into the room,
and then unlatched the porch-door which opened
to the outer air.</p>

<p>As she opened the door a great bank of snow
which had been piled up on the outside of it, fell
in about her feet. Ellen stepped back a little,
and then, standing still, she looked out into the
storm and listened. She had not listened long
before she thought she heard a distant cry. It
came from down the road. She listened again.
There came a blustering blast of wind which
rocked the trees, whirled the snow in her face,
roared in the chimneys over her head, and for a
moment drowned all other sounds. When this
had passed, Ellen listened again. She was sure
that she heard a distant cry.</p>

<p>"It is my father and mother!" she exclaimed;
"they are out in the storm!"</p>

<p>Ellen's aunt had taught her to be collected
and composed in all sudden and alarming emergencies,
and always to take time to consider calmly
what to do, however urgent the case might
be. She stood for a moment, therefore, quietly
where she was, and then determined to go
and wake her aunt, and tell her what she had
heard, and ask her what she had better do.</p>

<p>She tried to shut the door but she could not.
The snow that had fallen in prevented its closing.
So she left it open and went through the porch
to the inner door, and so back into the room,
taking care to shut the inner door as soon as
possible after she had passed through.</p>

<p>She went to the couch, and kneeling down
before it, she put her hand softly upon her aunt's
cheek and said, speaking in a low and gentle
tone,</p>

<p>"Aunt!&mdash;Aunt Anne!"</p>

<p>There was no answer.</p>

<p>"Aunt Anne!" she repeated. "Wake up a
moment;&mdash;I want to speak to you a moment."</p>

<p>There was still no answer. Ellen looked at
her aunt's pale and beautiful face for a moment,
in doubt whether to speak to her again; and
then she determined to give up the attempt to
awaken her, and to decide herself what to do.</p>

<p>After a little reflection she concluded that she
would go, a little way at least, and see if she
could learn what the cries were that she heard.
She accordingly went to a closet in her aunt's
bedroom, and took down a cloak which was
hanging there, and also a warm quilted hood.
These she put on. She then went into the back
room and got a pair of snow-shoes which hung
against the wall there. She carried these snow-shoes
into the porch, and put them down upon
the floor.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="r1">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>"Now," said she, "I will get the horn." The
horn which she referred to was made of tin. It
was kept hanging upon a nail near the back-door,
and was used for calling Hugh to dinner, when
he was far away from the house. It was very
hard to blow for one who was not accustomed to
it, but when it was blown skillfully it could be
heard a great way.</p>

<p>Ellen took down the horn from its nail, and
went back into the porch. She fastened the
snow shoes to her feet, and drawing the cloak
around her, she sallied out into the storm.</p>

<p>She could scarcely see where to go. The
wind blew the snow in her face, and every thing
was so covered that all the usual landmarks were
concealed from view. The snow was very light,
but the snow-shoes prevented her from sinking
into it. She walked on toward the road, without
however knowing exactly on what course she was
going. In fact, in coming out of the yard, she
inclined so far to the left, in her bewilderment,
that instead of going out at the gateway, she
passed over a corner of the fence, without knowing
it&mdash;fence and gateway being both alike deeply
buried in the snow.</p>

<div class="figleft w50">
<img src="images/illo_02.jpg" width="100%"
alt="THE SNOW SHOES."
title="THE SNOW SHOES." />
<p class="center">THE SNOW SHOES.</p>
</div>

<p>As soon as Ellen found that she was in the
road, she stopped, and turning her back to the
wind, blew a long and loud blast with her horn.
She then immediately paused to listen, in order
that she might hear if there should be any reply.
She heard a reply. It sounded like one or two
voices calling together. The voices were shrill.
As soon as the response ceased, Ellen blew her
horn again.</p>

<p>There was a second response&mdash;louder than the
preceding one. Ellen was very much pleased to
find that her signals were heard, and she immediately
began to walk on down the road, in the
direction from which the sounds had proceeded.</p>

<p>One makes but a slow and laborious progress
when walking upon snow-shoes. It is true that the
shoes do not sink far into the snow, but they sink
a little, and they are so large and unwieldy that
it is quite difficult to walk upon them. Besides,
the snow-shoes which Ellen wore were too large
for her.  They were made for a man.  Still
<a class="pagenum" id="page_580" title="pg 580"></a>
Ellen advanced without any serious difficulty,
though she was obliged to stop now and then to
rest. Whenever she stopped she would blow
her horn again, and listen for the response. The
response always came, and it became louder and
louder the farther she proceeded down the valley.</p>

<p>At length Ellen arrived at the place from which
the cries that she had heard proceeded. She
found there a horse and sleigh almost buried in
the snow, with her mother and Rodolphus in the
sleigh. It would be hard to say which was most
astonished, Ellen, to find her mother and Rodolphus
in such a situation, or Mrs. Linn, at
finding Ellen coming to their rescue.</p>

<p>"Why, mother!" exclaimed Ellen; "is this
you?"</p>

<p>"Why, Ellen!" said her mother; "is it possible
that this is you?"</p>

<p>"Why, mother!" said Ellen, more and more
astonished; "did you undertake to come up in
all this storm alone, with only Rodolphus?"</p>

<p>"No," said her mother, "Hugh came with us.
We have been four hours getting so far as here,
and when Hugh found that we could not get any
further, he left us and went away alone to get
some help."</p>

<p>"And you are almost frozen to death, I suppose,"
said Ellen.</p>

<p>"No," said her mother, "we are not very cold;
we are well wrapped up in buffalo robes, and the
bottom of the sleigh is filled with straw." Rodolphus
peeped out from beneath the mass of
coverings with which he was enveloped, unharmed,
but yet pale with anxiety and terror,
though now overjoyed at seeing Ellen.</p>

<p>"But I don't see now what we are to do, to
get home," said Ellen. "There is only one pair
of snow-shoes, and there are three of us to go."</p>

<p>"We must go one at a time, then," said Rodolphus.</p>

<p>"But when one has gone, how can we get the
snow-shoes back?" asked Ellen.</p>

<p>"I don't know, I am sure," said Mrs. Linn.
"I don't know what we shall do."</p>

<p>"Why did not father come with you?" asked
Ellen, despondingly.</p>

<p>"He was gone away," said her mother. "We
waited for him a long time, but he did not come,
and so Hugh said that he would leave his team
in the village for the night, and come with me.
But he went away some time ago, and I don't
know what can have become of him."</p>

<p>While this consultation had been going on,
the storm had continued to rage around them in
all its fury. The track behind the sleigh had
been wholly obliterated, the horse was half-buried,
and the snow was fast rising all around the sleigh
and threatening before long to overwhelm the
party entirely. They were entirely at a loss to
know what to do. So they paused a moment in
their perplexity, and during the pause, Ellen
thought that she heard another cry.</p>

<p>"Hark!" said she.</p>

<p>They all listened as well as the howling of the
wind around them would allow them to listen.
It was certainly a distant shout that they heard.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Ellen.</p>

<p>"It must be Hugh," said her mother.</p>

<p>Ellen raised the horn to her lips, and blew a
long and loud blast, turning the horn as she did
so, in the direction of the voice. They all listened
after the sound of the horn had ceased,
and heard a reply.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Ellen, "it must be Hugh. I
will go down to him on my snow-shoes."</p>

<p>"No," said Rodolphus, "you must not go and
leave us here alone."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Ellen, "I will go. I can give
him the snow-shoes and then he can go and get
some help for us."</p>

<p>Rodolphus declared that Ellen should not go,
and began to scream and cry in order to compel
his mother to prevent her, but his mother said
nothing, and Ellen went away. She said, as
she went,</p>

<p>"I will blow the horn now and then, mother,
and as long as you hear it, you will know that I
am safe."</p>

<p>Ellen went toiling on down the road, stopping
every few minutes to blow her horn, and to listen
to the responses of the voice. She soon found
that she was rapidly drawing near to the place
whence the sound proceeded. She perceived that
the voice was that of a man. She had no doubt
that it was Hugh, and that he had lost his way,
and was calling for help. She still felt great
anxiety, however, for she did not see, if it should
prove to be Hugh, what he could do with only
one pair of snow-shoes for four, to extricate such
a party from their perilous condition. She thought
of her aunt, too, lying sick and alone upon her
couch, and of the distress and anxiety which she
supposed the helpless patient would feel, if she
should wake up and find that both Martha and
Ellen had gone away, and left her, sick as she
was, in absolute solitude.</p>

<p>She, however, pressed diligently forward, and
at length found herself drawing nearer and nearer
to the voice. Presently she began to see a dark
mass lying helplessly in the snow just before
her.</p>

<p>"Hugh," said she, "are you here?"</p>

<p>"I am here," replied the voice, "but it is not
Hugh."</p>

<p>"Why, Antonio, is it you?" said Ellen. She
had recognized Antonio's voice. "How came
you to be here?"</p>

<p>"How came <i>you</i> to be here, is the question, I
think?" rejoined Antonio.</p>

<p>"I have got snow-shoes." said Ellen. "I
heard cries and I came out to see. My mother
and Rodolphus are up the road a little way, in a
sleigh, and the snow is covering them over very
fast. I'll blow my horn for them."</p>

<p>Here Ellen blew another long and loud blast
with her horn, and immediately afterward she
heard the distant call of her mother and of Rodolphus
answering it together.</p>

<p>"All right," said Antonio, "they answer.
Now the first thing to do is to get up to them.
Give me the snow-shoes, and I think I can carry
you right along."
<a class="pagenum" id="page_581" title="pg 581"></a></p>

<p>"Oh, no," said Ellen, "I am too heavy."</p>

<p>"Let us try," said Antonio. So saying he
climbed up out of the snow, as well as he could,
and put on the snow-shoes. They were very
easily put on. Antonio found that the snow-shoes
bore him up completely, but Ellen had
sunk down into the drift when she was deprived
of them. Antonio, however, soon raised her
again, and took her in his arms. Enveloped as
she was in her cloak, she made a rather large
looking load, though she was not very heavy.
Still it was difficult to carry even a light load,
walking with such shoes, on such a yielding surface,
and in such a storm. Antonio was obliged
to stop very often to rest and to take breath. At
such times, Ellen would blow her horn, and listen
for the answer. Thus they gradually got
back safely to the sleigh.</p>

<p>As they had thus come up the hill, Antonio, in
the intervals of his conversation with Ellen, had
determined on the course which he would pursue.
He knew that there was a snow-sled at Mr.
Randon's house; that is, a hand sled made light
and with the shoes of the runners very broad and
flat. By means of this construction, the sled
had, like the snow-shoes, the property of not
sinking much in the snow. Antonio determined
to go himself up to the house on the snow-shoes&mdash;leaving
Ellen with Rodolphus and her mother
in the sleigh&mdash;and get this sled, and he hoped,
by means of it, to draw them all up safely one
by one. The poor horse, he thought, would have
to be left in the drifts to die.</p>

<p>Antonio's plan succeeded completely. He put
Ellen under the buffalo robes in the sleigh and
covered her entirely in, except that he allowed
one little opening on one side for the horn, which
he advised her to blow from time to time, as it
might possibly help Hugh to find his way back
to them. He then left the party in the sleigh,
and was soon lost from view. He went toiling
up the hill to the house. He walked into the
yard. He groped his way to the barns and sheds,
but the doors were all blocked up with snow, so
that he could not get them open. He, however,
contrived to climb up upon a roof, and by that
means to get into a barn window. He left his
snow-shoes on the scaffold, and then groped his
way down in the dark to the place where Ellen
had told him that the snow-sled was kept. Every
thing was in such perfect order that he met with
no difficulty on the way. He found the sled, and
carrying it back to the barn window, he contrived
to heave it out there, throwing the snow-shoes
out after it.</p>

<p>He followed himself, descending as he had ascended,
by the roof of the shed. As soon as he
got into the road, he mounted upon his sled, and
guiding himself by the sound of the horn, which
he heard from time to time, and by the dark
forms of the firs which grew upon the sides of
the road, he slid quite rapidly down to the sleigh.
To his great relief and joy he found that Hugh
was there.</p>

<p>It proved that Hugh had lost his way, and he
would, perhaps, have perished had he not heard
the sound of the horn. The horn attracted his
attention just as he was about giving up in despair.
He supposed that the sound came from
some farmer's house, where the people were, for
some reason or other, blowing a horn. He succeeded
at last in making his way to the place
from which the sound proceeded, and was greatly
astonished to find himself back at the sleigh.</p>

<p>Antonio took Hugh home first. Each took the
snow-shoes by turns and drew the other on the
sled. When they reached the house, Antonio
left Hugh there, and returned himself, for the
others. The second time he took Rodolphus,
the third time, Ellen. Their mother insisted on
being left to the last. By the time that the party
were all safely conveyed to the house, Hugh had
got the barn-doors open, and had brought out a
yoke of oxen, with a lantern and shovels. He
then took the snow-shoes from Antonio, and putting
them upon his own feet, he walked on, to
mark the way, while Antonio followed with the
oxen. Antonio was, however, obliged to go behind
the oxen in driving them, so as to walk in
the path which they had broken. The snow was
up to the sides of the oxen all the way, and in
some places they came to drifts so deep, that Antonio
and Hugh were obliged to shovel the snow
away for a long time, before the oxen could get
through. At length, however, they reached the
place where the horse and sleigh had become
foundered. The horse was nearly exhausted
with fatigue and cold. Hugh and Antonio trod
down and shoveled away the snow around him,
and then unfastened the harness, so as to separate
the horse from the sleigh. They then turned
back the shafts of the sleigh, and fastened the
oxen to them by a chain, turning the heads of the
oxen up the hill. Hugh got into the sleigh, to
ride and drive the oxen. Antonio walked behind,
leading the horse. The road was now so broken,
that though the snow was very deep, and Antonio
and the horse both sank down very far into
it, it was possible for them to get along. They
stopped two or three times to rest, and twice to
shovel away the snow, but, at last, they safely
reached the house, and turning into the yard,
went directly to the barn.</p>

<p>"Now," said Hugh, "I can take care of every
thing here. You had better go into the house
and see if all is right there."</p>

<p>So Antonio went into the house. Ellen came
out to meet him at the porch-door, weeping as if
her heart would break. Antonio asked her what
was the matter. She said that her Aunt Anne
was dead.</p>

<p>Antonio tried to comfort Ellen as well as he
could, but it was very hard to comfort her. In
the course of the evening, however, she was
sometimes tolerably composed, and at one such
time, when she was sitting upon the settle, Antonio
took a seat by her side, and talked with her
a little while, about her going down to her mother
in the storm.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said he, "what <i>she</i> will think
of your having saved her life by your courage and
presence of mind; but you may depend, that I
<a class="pagenum" id="page_582" title="pg 582"></a>
shall not very soon forget your having saved
<i>mine</i>."</p>

<h3>II. DEATH.</h3>

<p>Rodolphus was very much shocked and overpowered
at witnessing the scene of anxiety and
sorrow, into which he found himself ushered,
when he arrived at the house. He sat down for
a time on Hugh's bench, in the corner, by the
fire, until he was warm. His mother then came
and undressed him and put him to bed in a sort
of attic chamber over the great room.</p>

<p>Rodolphus was afraid to be left alone in the
solitary chamber. The wind howled mournfully
among the trees of the neighboring forest, and
the snow clicked continually against the windows.
Rodolphus was, however, not afraid of
the storm&mdash;&mdash;nor was he afraid of robbers or of
ghosts. In fact, he did not know what he was
afraid of. Still he was afraid. Undutiful and
disobedient boys are always afraid when they are
left alone.</p>

<p>In fact, Rodolphus would have refused to go to
bed altogether, had it not been that his spirit was
awed and subdued by the presence of death, and
by the strange situation in which he so suddenly
found himself placed. Notwithstanding this,
however, he was upon the point of making some
resistance when his mother first came to him, to
take him away, but just then Antonio came into
the room, and perceiving that there was about to
be some difficulty, he stopped and looked at Rodolphus,
as if to see what he was going to do.
Rodolphus immediately submitted, and allowed
himself to be led away. He was more afraid of
Antonio, than he was even of being left alone in
his chamber.</p>

<p>The next morning when Rodolphus awoke
he found that the storm was still raging. He
looked out the window, and perceived that the air
was full of driving snow, while upon the ground
nothing was to be seen but vast and shapeless
masses of white. He rose, dressed himself, and
came down stairs. He found a great fire blazing
in the fire-place, but every thing was very still
and solitary about the house. The body had
been removed to the bedroom, and was laid out
there. The bedroom door was open. Hugh
and Antonio were out, trying to get into the
barn. Ellen was walking softly about the bedroom,
putting away the things which had been
used during the sickness, but which were now
needed no longer. Martha, who had got home
the evening before, while Ellen had been gone,
and had brought some of the neighbors with her,
was busy preparing the breakfast. Both she,
however, and Ellen, and the others who were
there, moved about silently, and spoke, when they
spoke at all, in a subdued and gentle tone, as if
they were afraid of disturbing the repose of the
dead.</p>

<p>When the breakfast was ready, Martha went
to call Hugh and Antonio and all the others, to
come to the table. They all came except Ellen.
She remained in the bedroom to watch with the
body of her aunt. Her heart was full of trouble.
As she sat by her aunt's bed-side, she thought
bitterly of her loss, and she looked forward with
many anxious forebodings to the future. She
felt as if her happiness was gone forever. She
loved her father and mother, it was true; but
her aunt had seemed to be her best and truest
friend; and now that her aunt was gone from
her forever, she felt alone and desolate.</p>

<p>After breakfast Antonio went away upon the
snow-shoes to see if he could obtain some assistance
from the neighbors, in relation to the funeral.
The storm, he said, appeared to have abated.
The clouds looked thin, and at one time he could
almost see the sun. In about two hours he returned,
bringing with him two or three men, all
upon snow-shoes; for the snow which had fallen
was so deep that any other mode of traveling was
impossible.</p>

<p>The preparations for the funeral went on during
the day. The third day the coffin came. It
was brought upon a snow-sled, which was drawn
by two men upon snow-shoes. The storm had
not yet entirely abated. The wind was high, and
the air was growing intensely cold. This was to
be expected. It is usually much colder in such
cases after the storm is over, than while the snow
continues to fall.</p>

<p>They dug the grave at some little distance from
the house, under the margin of a wood where
there was a little shelter. In digging it they
had first to go down through the deep snow, and
then with pick-axes and iron bars to dig into the
frozen ground. When the grave was ready they
put boards over it, to prevent its being filled up
again with the snow.</p>

<p>The funeral took place just at sunset. Hugh
had broken out a road to the place by means
of the oxen. The men placed the coffin on
a sled; it had been arranged that two of the
neighbors were to draw it. They said at first
that none but men could go to the grave, but
Ellen said that she <i>must</i> go.</p>

<p>"I can walk very well," said she, "I know, if
you can let me have a pair of the snow-shoes. I
<i>must</i> go. My aunt loved me and always took
care of me, and I must keep with her till the
very last."</p>

<p>When the men found how desirous she was to
go, they said that they could take another sled
and draw her. They said that if she would like
to take Rodolphus with her, they could draw him,
too; but Rodolphus said, that he did not wish
to go.</p>

<p>When all was ready, the company assembled
in the great room, and Antonio read a prayer
which Ellen found in a prayer-book that had belonged
to her Aunt Anne. It was a prayer suitable
to a funeral occasion. When the prayer had
been read, the funeral procession moved mournfully
from the door.</p>

<p>The coffin went first, covered as it lay upon
the sled with a black cloak for a pall, and drawn
by two men. The other sled followed, drawn also
by two men. Ellen was seated upon the second
sled, wrapped in buffalo robes. The road had
been broken out, so as to be passable, but the
snow was very deep, and the men made their
<a class="pagenum" id="page_583" title="pg 583"></a>
way with great difficulty through it.  They
stopped once or twice on the way to rest.</p>

<div class="figleft w50">
<img src="images/illo_03.jpg" width="100%"
alt="THE FUNERAL."
title="THE FUNERAL." />
<p class="center">THE FUNERAL.</p>
</div>

<p>When they arrived at the grave, they found
that the sun was shining pleasantly upon the
spot, and the trees sheltered it from the wind.
Still it seemed to Ellen, as she looked down into
the deep pit from the top of the snow which surrounded
it, that it was a very cold grave. The
men let the coffin down, and then two of them
remained to fill the earth in again, while Hugh
and Antonio drew Ellen home.</p>

<p>Distressed and unhappy as Ellen was at the
death of her aunt, there was another blow still
to come upon her. She found when she reached
the house on her return from the funeral, that
the whole family were in a state of consternation
and terror at the tidings which had arrived from
the village, that her father had perished in the
storm. He had been across the river when the
storm came on. In attempting to return, his
horse had become exhausted in the snow, and
he was forced to abandon him and attempt to
find his way home alone. He lost his way and
wandered about till his strength failed, and then,
benumbed with the cold, and wearied with the
hopeless toil, he sank down into a drift, and fell
asleep. Of course, he never woke again. He
was found when the storm was over, by means
of a small dark spot formed by a part of his
shoulder, which projected above the surface of
the snow.</p>

<p>It was thus that Rodolphus lost his father.</p>

<h3>III.&mdash;CONSEQUENCES OF BAD TRAINING.</h3>

<p>One pleasant morning in the month of June,
during the next summer after the great storm,
Rodolphus was drawing his sister Annie about the
yard in a little green cart which her sister Ellen
kept for her. There was a great
elm-tree in the middle of the yard,
with a path leading all around it.
Rodolphus was going round and
round this tree. Annie was
playing that Rodolphus was her
horse, and she had reins to drive
him by. She also had a little
whip to whip him with when he
did not go fast enough.</p>

<p>Presently Ellen came to the
door. She had a small hammer
in one hand, and a box containing
some small nails and tags of
leather in the other. She was
going to train up a climbing rose,
which had been planted by the
side of the door.</p>

<p>Ellen told Rodolphus that she
thought it was time for him to
get ready to go to school.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said Rodolphus,
"it is not time yet;" so he went
prancing and galloping on around
the great tree.</p>

<p>A moment afterward his mother
came to the door.</p>

<p>"Rodolphus," said she, "it is
time for you to go to school."</p>

<p>"Oh no, mother, not yet," said
Rodolphus.</p>

<p>"Yes," said his mother, "it is quite time.
Come in directly."</p>

<p>"Well, mother," said Rodolphus, "I will."</p>

<p>Mrs. Linn stopped a moment to look at Ellen's
rose-tree, and to say "How pretty it looks climbing
up here by the door;" and then she went in.
Rodolphus continued to run round the yard.
Presently he came prancing up to the door, and
stopped to see what Ellen was doing.</p>

<p>"Rodolphus," said Ellen, "you ought to obey
mother. She said that you must go to school."</p>

<p>"Oh, pretty soon," said Rodolphus. "She is
not in any hurry."</p>

<p>"Yes, Rodolphus," said Annie, in a very positive
manner. "You ought to obey my mother.
You must go to school."</p>

<p>So saying, Annie began to move as if she were
going to get out of the cart, but Rodolphus perceiving
this, immediately began to draw the cart
along, and thus prevented her. She could not
get out while the cart was going.</p>

<p>Rodolphus continued to run about for some
time longer. Annie begged of him to stop and
let her get out, but he would not. At length his
mother came to the door again, and renewed her
commands. She said that unless he stopped
playing with the cart, and went to school immediately,
she should certainly punish him.</p>

<p>"Why, mother," said Rodolphus, "it is not
late. Besides, I am going to draw Annie to
school in the cart, and so we shall go very
quick."</p>

<p>"No," said his mother, "you must not take
<a class="pagenum" id="page_584" title="pg 584"></a>
the cart to school. If you do, it will come to
some damage."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said Rodolphus. "Go and get me
Annie's books, and I will start off directly."</p>

<p>His mother went into the house and brought
out a spelling-book, and put it down on the step
of the door. She called out at the same time to
Rodolphus, who was at that time near the great
tree, telling him that there was the book, and that
he must leave the cart, and take Annie and the
book, and go directly.</p>

<p>The reason why Mrs. Linn was so solicitous
for the safety of the cart, was because it was Ellen's
cart, and she knew that Ellen prized it very
highly. The way that Ellen came to have such
a cart was this:</p>

<p>One day she was walking alone near the back
fence of the garden, at a place where the fence
was very high and close, when she heard the
voices of some children on the other side, in a
little green lane, where children often used to
play. Ellen thought she heard Rodolphus's
voice among the others, and there appeared to
be some difficulty, as in fact there usually was,
where Rodolphus's voice could be heard. So Ellen
climbed upon a sort of trellis, which had been
made there against the fence, in order that she
might look over and see what was the matter.</p>

<p>She found that there were two girls there with
a small cart, and that Rodolphus had got into
the cart, and was insisting that the girls should
draw him along. The girls looked troubled and
distressed, and were not trying to draw.</p>

<p>"Pull," said Rodolphus. "Pull away, hearty."</p>

<p>"No," said the girls&mdash;&mdash;"we can't pull. It is
too heavy&mdash;&mdash;besides, you will break down our
cart."</p>

<p>"Rodolphus!" said Ellen.</p>

<p>Rodolphus turned his head, and saw his sister
looking down upon him from the top of the
fence.</p>

<p>"Ellen," said he, "is that you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Ellen, "I would not trouble those
poor girls. Let them have their cart."</p>

<p>"Why, they could pull me just as well as not,"
said Rodolphus, "if they would only try. Come,
girls," he added, "give one good pull, and then
I will get out."</p>

<p>The girls hesitated a moment, being obviously
afraid that the cart would be broken. They
looked up to Ellen, as if they hoped that in some
way or other she could help them, but Ellen
knew not what to do. So they concluded to
submit to Rodolphus's terms. They made a
desperate effort to draw the cart along a few
steps, but the result which they had feared was
realized. The cart went on, staggering, as it
were, under its heavy burden, for a short space,
and then a crack was heard, and one side of it
sank suddenly down to the ground. The axletree
had broken, close to the wheel.</p>

<p>The children seemed greatly distressed at this
accident. Rodolphus got out of the cart, and
looked at the fracture&mdash;&mdash;appearing perplexed in
his turn, and not knowing what to say. The
oldest girl took up the wheel, and began to examine
the fracture with a very sorrowful countenance,
while the youngest looked on, the picture
of grief and despair.</p>

<p>"Now, Mary," said the youngest child, in a
very desponding tone, "I don't believe we can
sell our cart at all."</p>

<p>"Do you wish to sell it?" asked Ellen.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mary. "Father said that we
might sell it, if we could find any body that
would buy it; but now it is broken, I don't suppose
that any body will."</p>

<p>"How much do you ask for it?" said Ellen.</p>

<p>"A quarter of a dollar," said Mary.</p>

<p>"Well," replied Ellen, "perhaps <i>I</i> will buy
it. If you will bring it round to our house this
evening after tea, I will get Antonio to look at it
and see if it is worth a quarter of a dollar; or,
rather, if it <i>was</i> worth a quarter of a dollar before
it was broken&mdash;&mdash;for that will make no difference;
and if he says it was, perhaps I may buy
it."</p>

<p>"Well," said Mary, "we will."</p>

<p>"Is Beechnut coming to our house this evening?"
asked Rodolphus.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Ellen.</p>

<p>The girls seemed much relieved of their distress
at hearing this. Mary took up the broken
wheel and put it into the cart, saying at the
same time,</p>

<p>"Come, Ally, let us carry it home."</p>

<p>Mary stooped down to take hold of one side
of the cart, while her sister took hold of the
other, and so they lifted it up.</p>

<p>"Rodolphus," said Ellen, "I think you had
better help them carry the cart home."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Rodolphus, "I will."</p>

<p>So Rodolphus took the wheel out of the cart
and gave it to Mary to carry, and then lifting up
the cart bodily, he put it upside down upon his
head, as if it were a cap, and then began to run
after the girls with it. They fled, filling the air
with shouts of laughter, and thus the three went
off together, all in high glee.</p>

<p>The end of it was, that Ellen bought the cart,
and Antonio made a new axletree for it, and put
it, in all respects, in complete repair. He also
painted it beautifully inside and out, making it
look better than when it was new. Ellen's motive
in getting the cart was chiefly to promote
Annie's amusement, but still she valued it herself,
very highly.</p>

<p>She used often to lend it to Rodolphus when
he was playing with Annie in the yard, and Rodolphus
would draw his sister about in it. Ellen
always gave him many cautions not to go too
fast, and was very careful never to allow him to
put any thing inside that would bruise or soil it.
There was a little seat inside for Annie to sit
upon, with a box beneath it where a small basket
of provisions could be stored, in case of an excursion.
Beechnut had promised, too, to make
Annie a whip, and Ellen was going to make her
a pair of reins, so that when Rodolphus was
drawing her she might play drive.</p>

<p>But to return to the story.</p>

<p>Rodolphus drew the cart up to the door, and
<a class="pagenum" id="page_585" title="pg 585"></a>
taking up the book, he put it upon Annie's lap
and then began to move away again.</p>

<p>"Stop," said Annie; "stop, and let me get
out."</p>

<p>"No," said Rodolphus, "I am going to draw
you to school."</p>

<p>"No," said Annie, "my mother said that you
must not take my cart to school."</p>

<p>"Oh, she won't care," said Rodolphus, still
going.</p>

<p>"But she said that you must <i>
ot</i>," persisted
Annie.</p>

<p>"That was because she thought the cart would
come to some damage," said Rodolphus. "But
it will not come to any damage. I shall bring
it home all safe at noon, and then she won't
care."</p>

<p>By this time Rodolphus had got out into the
road. Annie looked anxious and distressed, but
as Rodolphus walked rapidly on, she was entirely
helpless, and could do nothing but sit still,
though she urged Rodolphus to stop, again and
again, until at last, finding that it did no good,
she gave up in despair, and resigned herself to
her fate.</p>

<p>They proceeded in this way until they had got
pretty near the village, when, as they were going
along the road, which at this place led near the
margin of the river, just below the bridge and
mill, Rodolphus saw two boys getting into a
boat. He asked them where they were going;
they said that they were going a-fishing.</p>

<div class="figleft w50">
<img src="images/illo_04.jpg" width="100%"
alt="THE BOYS AND THE BOAT."
title="THE BOYS AND THE BOAT." />
<p class="center">THE BOYS AND THE BOAT.</p>
</div>

<p>"I mean to go too," said Rodolphus, looking
toward Annie.</p>

<p>"No," said Annie, "you must not go, for then
what shall I do with my cart?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you can draw your cart along to school
yourself, very well," said Rodolphus, and so saying,
he lifted Annie hastily and roughly out of
the cart, calling out at the same time to the boys
to wait a minute for him. He put the handle,
which was at the end of the tongue of the cart,
into Annie's hand, and then ran down to the
water; and thus, almost before Annie had time
to recover from her astonishment, she found herself
left alone in the road, while the boat, with
Rodolphus and the other boys in it, began slowly
to recede from the shore.</p>

<p>Annie began to cry. Rodolphus called out to
her in a rough voice to go along to school. So
she began to walk slowly along, drawing the cart
wearily after her.</p>

<p>On her way home from school that day, when
she came to the place in the road where Rodolphus
had left her in the morning, she found him
waiting there for her. She was coming without
the cart. Rodolphus asked her what she had
done with it. She said that she had left it at
school. The teacher had told her that it was too
heavy for her to draw, and had put it in a corner,
to wait till Rodolphus came. Rodolphus then
told Annie to sit down upon a stone by the side
of the road till he came back, and then began to
run toward the school-house. In a short time
he came back bringing the cart.
He put Annie into it and went toward
home.</p>

<p>Annie asked him where he had
been all the day&mdash;but he did not
answer. He seemed discontented
and uneasy, and preserved a moody
silence all the way home, except that
once he turned and charged Annie
not to tell his mother or Ellen that
he had not been at school that day.
When he reached home, he left the
cart at the door, and stepping into
the entry he began to call out aloud,</p>

<p>"Mother! Mother!"</p>

<p>Ellen came to the door and said
in a gentle voice,</p>

<p>"Mother can't come now, Rolfy;
she is busy."</p>

<p>"But I want to see her a minute,"
said he. "Mother! Mother!"</p>

<p>A moment afterward his mother
appeared at her bedroom window.</p>

<p>"What do you want, Rolfy?"
said she.</p>

<p>Rodolphus said nothing, but stood
still, pointing to the cart, with a triumphant
air.</p>

<p>"What?" said his mother.</p>

<p>"See!" said Rodolphus.</p>

<p>"What is it?" said she.</p>

<p>"The cart," said Rodolphus,
"all safe."
<a class="pagenum" id="page_586" title="pg 586"></a></p>

<p>"Well," said his mother, "what then?"</p>

<p>"Why, you said," replied Rodolphus, "that if
I took it to school, it would come to some damage."</p>

<p>"Well, it <i>might</i> have come to some damage,"
said she, "you know. And you ought not to have
taken it."</p>

<p>So saying his mother went away from the
window.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Rodolphus was, in fact, a source of continual
trial and trouble to his mother, though she did not
know one half of his evil deeds. He concealed
them from her very easily, for she never made a
careful inquiry into his conduct when he was out
of her sight. He played truant continually, going
off to play with idle boys. He fell into bad company,
and formed many evil habits. He was continually
getting into mischief among the neighbors. They
complained of him sometimes, to his mother, but
this did no good. Generally, she would not believe
any thing that they said against him, and
whenever any of his evil deeds were fully proved
to her, she made so many excuses for him, and
looked upon his misconduct with so indulgent a
view, that she exercised no restraint upon him
whatever.</p>

<p>He wanted more money than his mother could
furnish him with, and he gradually fell into dishonest
means of obtaining it. His sister Ellen
had some poultry, and once a-week she used to
commission him to carry the eggs into the village
for sale. Ellen used to go out every morning to
get the eggs from her nests, but Rodolphus would
often go out before her, and take a part of the
eggs and hide them. These he would consider
his own, and so when he carried her supply to
market, he would secretly add to them those he
had thus purloined, so as to get more money for
the eggs than he returned to her. He used to
get the apples, too, from the neighbors' orchards,
and once when he was in a store in a village,
and saw a little money upon the counter, which
a girl had laid down there to pay for some thread,
and which the store-keeper had forgotten to put
away, Rodolphus, watching his opportunity, slipped
it into his pocket and went away with it.
He felt very guilty after he had done this, for
several days; but still he kept the money.</p>

<p>Ellen was the only person who had any influence
over Rodolphus, and she had not a great
deal. She was, however, herself a great help
and a great source of comfort to her mother.
As soon as she came home, she began in a very
modest and unassuming manner, to introduce the
system and order which had prevailed in her
aunt's household, into that of her mother. She
began with Annie's and Rodolphus' playthings,
which, when she first came home, were scattered
all over the house in disorder and confusion.
She collected these playthings all together, repaired
the books which were damaged, mended
the broken toys, and arranged them all neatly
upon a shelf which her mother allowed her to
use for the purpose. Then she gradually put
the rooms in the house in order, one after another.
She drove up nails in convenient places,
to hang implements and utensils upon. She induced
Rodolphus to put the yard and the grounds
about the house in order. Every useless thing
that would burn, was put upon the wood-pile,
and all other rubbish cleared away. She planted
the seeds of climbing plants about the gateways,
and near the windows of the house, and in one
corner she made a very pretty trellis, by tying
poles together with a kind of very flexible wire
called binding wire. Antonio showed her how
to do it. In fact, by means of what Ellen did,
the house was in a very few months entirely
transformed, and became one of the neatest and
pleasantest cottages in all the town; and she
and her mother and Annie would have lived together
very happily in it, had it not been for the
anxiety and trouble which Rodolphus gave them.</p>

<p>One day Antonio, who often came to Mrs.
Linn's to see if there was any thing he could do
for the family, and who had often talked with
Rodolphus about the evil of his ways, drove up
to the gate in a wagon, and proposed to Rodolphus
to go and take a ride with him.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Rodolphus, "I will go."</p>

<p>"Go and ask your mother first," said Antonio.</p>

<p>"Oh, she will let me go, I know," said Rodolphus,
coming at the same time toward the
wagon.</p>

<p>"Go and ask her," said Antonio.</p>

<p>So Rodolphus went and asked his mother, and
she gave him leave. He then ran back to the
wagon, climbed up into it, and took his seat by
the side of Antonio.</p>

<p>In the course of this ride, Antonio had a long
and plain conversation with Rodolphus about his
evil course of life, and the sorrows and sufferings
to which it would lead him, and in which it
would involve his mother and sister, if he went
on as he had begun. He told him, however, that
if on the other hand he would make a change, if
he would obey his mother, and go regularly to
school, and keep away from bad company, and
become industrious and honest, he would grow
up to be a useful and respectable man, and would
make himself and all around him happy.</p>

<p>Rodolphus heard what Antonio said, patiently
and attentively through to the end, and then
said,</p>

<p>"Yes, Beechnut, my sister Ellen told me that
very same thing, and I have tried to be a better
boy, very hard indeed, but I can't."</p>

<p>However, notwithstanding this, Rodolphus
promised Antonio that he would try once more,
and for several days after this conversation he
was a much better boy. He went to school regularly
and was more willing to help his mother
and Ellen about the house. This lasted for
about a week.</p>

<p>At the end of that time he was one evening
working with Ellen in the garden, about sunset,
when he heard a sound near him by a wall.
There was an old stone wall on that side of the
garden, with bushes which grew upon the outside
rising above it. Rodolphus looked up when
he heard the noise, and saw a boy's head just
<a class="pagenum" id="page_587" title="pg 587"></a>
over the wall at an opening among the bushes.
The boy held his finger to his lips in
token of silence and secrecy, pointing
very quickly to Ellen, whose
face at that instant was turned the
other way, so that she did not see
him; he then dropped down behind
the wall out of sight again.</p>

<p>Rodolphus knew that the boy wished
to speak to him, and that he was
prevented from doing so because Ellen
was there.</p>

<p>Accordingly a moment afterward,
Rodolphus told Ellen that she had
better go in, and that he would finish
the rest of the work and come in
presently with the tools. Ellen
thanked Rodolphus for what she supposed
was his disinterested kindness,
and went in.</p>

<p>As soon as Rodolphus was alone,
the boy's head appeared above the
wall again.</p>

<p>"She's gone at last," said he. "I thought
she never <i>would</i> go." The boy then seemed to
rise higher, as if he were stepping up upon a
stone outside the wall. He held out his hand
toward Rodolphus, saying, "See there!"</p>

<p>Rodolphus looked, and saw that he had three
half dollars in his hand.</p>

<p>"Where did you get that money?" said Rodolphus.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the boy, winking, and looking
very mysterious, "don't you wish you knew!
You'd like to find the nest that has such eggs
as those in it, wouldn't you? Well, I'll tell you
all about it to-night. Come out here after nine
o'clock. I will be here to meet you. We have
got plenty of money and we're going to have a
good time."</p>

<p>Soon after this Rodolphus carried his tools to
the shed, and went in to his supper. About
eight o'clock it became dark, and at half-past
eight, Rodolphus said that he felt rather tired
and he believed that he would go to bed. Feeling
guilty and self-condemned as he did, he appeared
absent-minded and dejected, and Ellen
was anxious about him. She was afraid that
he was going to be sick. She lighted the lamp
for him, and went up with him to his room and
did all that she could to make him comfortable.
At length she bade him good-night and went
away.</p>

<p>The place where Rodolphus slept was in a little
corner of an attic by a great chimney. The
place had been partitioned off, and there was a
door leading into it. This door had a hasp on
the inside. There was also a small window
which opened out upon the roof of a shed. It
was a pretty long step from the window down
to the roof of the shed, but yet Rodolphus had
often got down there, although his mother had
repeatedly forbidden him ever to do so.</p>

<div class="figright w50">

alt="THE EVASION."
title="THE EVASION." />
<p class="center">THE EVASION.</p>
</div>

<p>As soon as Ellen was gone, Rodolphus fastened
the door and then waited a little while till
all was still. Then he opened the window very
gently and crept out. He put out his light the
last thing before he got out of the window, and
crept down upon the roof of the shed. He stopped
here to listen. All was still. He walked
softly, with his shoes in his hand, down to the
lower edge of the roof, and there he got down to
the ground by means of a fence which joined the
shed at one corner there.</p>

<p>Rodolphus found the boys waiting for him beyond
the garden wall. He went away with them
and spent the night in carousals and wickedness,
under a barn in a solitary place. About one
o'clock he came back to the house. He climbed
up the fence and got upon the shed. He crept
along the shed softly, with his shoes in his hand
as before, and got into his window. When in,
he shut down the window, undressed himself,
and went to bed.</p>

<p>And this was the end of all Rodolphus's resolutions
to reform.</p>

<h3>IV. CRIME.</h3>

<p>Rodolphus went on in the evil way which we
described, for some time, and at length he became
so disorderly in his conduct and so troublesome,
and caused his mother so much anxiety
and care, that she finally concluded to follow the
advice which all the neighbors had very frequently
given her, and bind the boy out to some master
to learn a trade. As soon as she had decided
upon this course, she asked the assistance of Mr.
Randon, to find a good place. Mr. Randon made
a great many inquiries but he could not find any
place that would do, in Franconia; all the persons
to whom he applied in the village declined
taking Rodolphus, giving various reasons for
their refusals. Some did not want any new apprentice,
some had other boys in view that they
were going to apply to. Some said that Rodolphus
was too old, others that he was too
young. Mr. Randon thought that the real reason
probably was, in a great many of these cases,
that the men did not like Rodolphus's character.
In fact, one man to whom he made application,
after listening attentively to Mr. Randon, until
he came to mention the name of the boy, said,
<a class="pagenum" id="page_588" title="pg 588"></a></p>

<p>"What! Rodolphus Linn. Is it Rodolphus
Linn?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mr. Randon.</p>

<p>"Hoh!" said the man. "I would not have
Rodolphus Linn in my shop for a hundred dollars
a year."</p>

<p>At last, however, Mr. Randon found in another
town, about twenty-five miles from Franconia, a
man who kept a livery stable, that said he wanted
a boy. This man's name was Kerber. Mr.
Kerber said that if Rodolphus was a stout and
able-bodied boy, he would take him. Mr. Randon
said that Rodolphus was stout enough, but he
frankly told Mr. Kerber that the boy was rather
rude and unmanageable. "I'll take care of that,"
said Mr. Kerber. "All I want is to have him
<i>able</i> to do his duty. If he is only able to do it,
you need not fear but that I'll find ways and
means of seeing that it is done."</p>

<p>Mr. Randon thought from this conversation,
and from other indications, that Mr. Kerber was
a very harsh man, and he thought that Rodolphus
might be likely to have a hard time if apprenticed
to him. He concluded, therefore, that before
making his report to Mrs. Linn, he would make
some further inquiry. He found at last another
man in the same town with Mr. Kerber, who was
willing to take Rodolphus. This man was a carpenter.
The carpenter was a man of quiet and
gentle spirit, and he bore a most excellent character
among his neighbors. At first, the carpenter
was unwilling to take Rodolphus when he
heard what his character was, but when Mr. Randon
told him about the circumstances of the family,
and explained to him that it would be a deed of
great benevolence to save the boy from ruin, the
carpenter said he would take him for three months
upon trial, and then if he found that he should
probably succeed in making him a good boy, he
would take him regularly as his apprentice. So
Mr. Randon went back to report the result of his
inquiries to Rodolphus's mother.</p>

<p>Mrs. Linn was very anxious to have Rodolphus
go to the carpenter's, but Rodolphus himself insisted
on going to Mr. Kerber's. The reason why
he wished to go there was, because Mr. Kerber
kept a stable and horses. He supposed that his
chief business would be to tend the horses, and
to ride about. This would be much better, he
thought, than to work hard all day with planes,
and saws, and chisels.</p>

<p>Ellen joined her mother in begging Rodolphus
to go to the carpenter's, but he could not be persuaded
to consent, and so it was finally settled
that he should be bound apprentice to Mr. Kerber.
Mrs. Linn, however, made an express stipulation
that while Rodolphus remained at Mr.
Kerber's he was never on any account to be whipped.
If he neglected his duty or behaved badly,
Mr. Kerber was to find out some other way to
punish him beside whipping.</p>

<p>Mr. Kerber made no objection to this arrangement.
He said to Mr. Randon, when Mr. Randon
proposed this condition to him, that he would
make any agreement of that kind that his mother
desired. "I have learned," said he, "that there
are various contrivances for breaking refractory
colts besides silk snappers."</p>

<p>When a boy is bound apprentice to a master,
a certain paper is executed between the master
on the one part, and the parent or guardian of the
boy on the other, which is called the Indentures.
The indentures specify the name and age of the
boy, and state the time for which he is bound to
the master. During that time the boy is bound
to work for the master, and to obey his orders.
The master is bound to provide food and clothing
for the boy, and to teach him the trade. He has
a right to compel the boy to attend industriously
to his work, and to punish him for any idleness,
or disobedience, or insubordination that he may
be guilty of. In a word, the master acquires, for
the time that the apprenticeship continues, the
same rights that the father, if the boy has a
father, possessed before.</p>

<p>According to this custom indentures of apprenticeship
were regularly drawn up, binding Rodolphus
to Mr. Kerber till he was twenty-one years
of age. He was then nearly twelve. The indentures
were signed, and Rodolphus went to live
with his new master.</p>

<p>He, however, soon began to have a pretty hard
life of it. He found that his business was not to
ride the horses about, but to perform the most
disagreeable and servile work in the stable. He
could not even ride the horses to water, for there
was a great trough in one corner of the stable
with a stream of water always running into it,
and the horses were all watered there. Rodolphus
was employed in harnessing and unharnessing
the horses, and rubbing them down when
they came in; and in pitching down hay, and
measuring out oats and corn for them. He had
to work also a great deal at the house, splitting
wood and carrying it in, and in bringing water
for the washing. He was kept hard at work all
the time, except in the evening, when he was
generally allowed to roam about the streets wherever
he pleased.</p>

<p>Rodolphus did not have much open difficulty
with Mr. Kerber, for he found out very soon that
it was a very dangerous business to disobey him.
The first lesson that he had on that subject was
as follows:</p>

<p>One afternoon when he had been at work at the
house, and had had some difficulty with Mrs. Kerber,
he undertook to make her agree to some of
his demands by threatening, as he had been accustomed
to do with his mother, that if she did
not let him do what he wished, he would go and
jump into the pond. This pond was a small
mill pond which came up to the foot of Mr. Kerber's
garden, where the garden was bounded by
a high wall. Mrs. Kerber took no notice of this
threat at the time, but when her husband came
home she told him about it at the supper table.</p>

<p>"Ah," said Mr. Kerber, when his wife had
finished her statement; "he threatened to drown
himself, then? I am afraid he does not know
exactly what drowning is. I will enlighten him
a little upon the subject after supper."</p>

<p>Accordingly, after supper, Mr. Kerber commanded
<a class="pagenum" id="page_589" title="pg 589"></a>
Rodolphus to follow him. Mr. Kerber
led the way down to the bottom of the garden,
and there he tied a rope round Rodolphus's waist,
and threw him off into the water, and kept him
there until he was half strangled. He would
pull him up a moment to recover his breath, and
then plunge him in again and again, until the
poor boy was half dead with exhaustion and terror.
Then, pulling him out upon the bank, he
left him to come to himself, and to return to the
house at his leisure.</p>

<p>Rodolphus, after this, was very careful not to
come into any open collision with Mr. Kerber, or
with his wife, but this kind of severity did him,
after all, no real good. When a boy has grown to
such an age as that of Rodolphus, in habits of
self-indulgence, disobedience, and insubordination,
it is almost impossible to save him by any
means whatever&mdash;&mdash;but heartless severity like this
only makes him worse. Rodolphus hated his
master, and he determined to do as little for him
as he possibly could. Mr. Kerber, accordingly,
was continually finding fault with his apprentice
for his idleness and his neglect of duty, and he
used often to punish him by putting him in what
he called his <i>prison</i>.</p>

<p>This prison was a stall in one corner of the
stable, near a little room which Mr. Kerber used
for his office and counting-room. The stall had
been boarded up in front, some years before, and
used to shut up a small colt in. It was half full
of boxes and barrels, and there was a heap of
straw in one corner of it. There was a door in
front, with a great wooden button outside. When
Mr. Kerber got out of patience with Rodolphus,
he used to put him into this old colt-pen and
button him in, and sometimes keep him there
without any thing to eat, till he was half starved.
At one time Mr. Kerber kept him there all night.</p>

<p>After the first half dozen times that Rodolphus
was shut up there, he did not suffer from hunger,
for he made an arrangement with another stable
boy, older than himself, to supply him with food
at such times. The stable boy would get bread
from the house by stealth, when Rodolphus was
in his prison, and bring it out to the stable in his
pocket. Then, watching his opportunity, when
Mr. Kerber was not looking, he would throw it
over to Rodolphus. Rodolphus was thus saved
from suffering much through hunger, but yet he
would always in such cases, when he was finally
let out, <i>pretend</i> to be half starved, in order to
prevent Mr. Kerber's suspecting that he had been
stealthily supplied with food.</p>

<p>The prison, as Mr. Kerber called it, was adjoining
the stable office, which was a very small
room, partitioned off from the stable itself. This
office had two doors, one on each side of it. One
door led out into the stable, and was the one ordinarily
used. The other led to a shed at one
side of the stable, where the wood was kept for
the office fire, which was made in a small stove
that stood in one corner of the office. There
was a desk in another corner of the office, and
in this desk Mr. Kerber kept his papers and his
money.</p>

<p>One day when Rodolphus was shut up in his
prison, after having been there several hours, he
became very tired of having nothing to do, and
so, to amuse himself, he took his knife out from
his pocket and began to cut into the partition
which separated the colt-pen from the office.
The partition was made of boards, and as Rodolphus's
knife was pretty sharp, he could cut
into it quite easily. He heard voices in the office,
and he thought that if he should cut a small
hole quite through the partition he could hear
what the men were saying, and see what they
were doing. So he cut away very diligently for
half an hour, working very slowly and carefully
all the time, so as not to make a noise.</p>

<p>At last the light began to shine through. Then
Rodolphus worked more carefully than ever. He,
however, soon had a small hole opened, and putting
his eye close to it, he could see a whip hanging
up against the opposite wall of the office.
Rodolphus gradually enlarged his hole, until he
could see more. He made the hole very large
on the side toward his prison, and yet kept it
very small toward the office, and by this means
he could change the position of his eye and so
see almost all over the office, without, however,
having made the opening large enough to attract
attention on the inside.</p>

<p>Rodolphus saw Mr. Kerber and another man
sitting by the desk. It was summer, and there
was no fire in the stove. There were a great
many whips hanging up on one side of the room,
and a hammer, together with an instrument called
a nut-wrench, on a shelf over the desk. The
door leading out into the shed was fastened with
a hasp. Rodolphus, as he looked at it, thought
that it would be easy for a thief, if he wished to
break into the office, to go into the shed and bore
into the door of the office just above the hasp,
and then by putting in a slender iron rod, the
hasp might be lifted up out of the staple, and the
door opened.</p>

<p>Rodolphus listened to the conversation between
Mr. Kerber and his visitor, but he could not understand
it very well. It was all about business.
At last the man took a large leather purse out
of his pocket, and prepared to pay Mr. Kerber
some money. Mr. Kerber unlocked his desk.
The man counted out the money upon a small
table which was there. Mr. Kerber counted it
after him, and then took from his desk a small
box, made of iron, which he called his strong
box. He unlocked the strong box with a key
that he took from his pocket, and put the money
into it. He then locked the strong box and put
it back into the desk, and finally shut down the
lid of the desk, locked it, and put the key in his
pocket.</p>

<p>Mr. Kerber kept Rodolphus confined in his
prison much longer than usual that day, so long,
in fact, that Rodolphus became at last very impatient
and very angry. At length, however,
Mr. Kerber let him out, and sent him home to
supper.</p>

<p>That evening about nine o'clock, as Rodolphus
was talking with some of the bad boys with
<a class="pagenum" id="page_590" title="pg 590"></a>
whom he was accustomed to spend his evenings,
and telling them how he hated his tyrannical and
cruel master, he said, among other things, that
he wished he knew some thief or robber. The
boys asked him why.</p>

<p>"Why, I would tell him," said Rodolphus,
"how he might rob old Kerber, and get as much
money as he wanted."</p>

<p>Among the boys who were with Rodolphus at
this time, was one named Gilpin. Gilpin was a
very bad boy indeed, and considerably older than
Rodolphus. He was about fourteen years old.
When Gilpin heard Rodolphus say this, he gave
him a little jog with his elbow, as an intimation
not to say any thing more. Very soon Gilpin
took Rodolphus away, and walked on with him
alone, along a wall which extended down toward
the water from the place where the boys had
been playing. As soon as he had drawn Rodolphus
away from the other boys, he asked him
what he meant by what he had said about a good
chance to get some money. So Rodolphus explained
to Gilpin how his master had shut him
up in the stall, and how he had cut a hole through
the partition, and what he had seen in the office.
He also explained to him how the back door of
the little office was fastened by a hasp, which it
would be easy to open by boring a hole through
the door, if the robber only had a bit and a bit-stock.</p>

<p>"Oh, we can get a bit and bit-stock, easily
enough," said Gilpin.</p>

<p>"Well," said Rodolphus, "shall we do it?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Gilpin, "why not we as well
as any body else. I want money too much to
leave any good chance for getting it to other
people. You and I will get it, and go shares."</p>

<p>"No," said Rodolphus, "I don't dare to.
And, besides, if we should get into the office,
we could not open the desk. He keeps the desk
locked."</p>

<p>"We can pry it open with a chisel," said Gilpin,
"as easy as a man would open on oyster."</p>

<p>"But then we can't open the strong box,"
said Rodolphus. "The strong box is made of
iron."</p>

<p>"We'll carry away the strong box and all,"
said Gilpin, "and get it open at our leisure afterward."</p>

<p>Rodolphus was at first strongly disinclined to
enter into this plot, and it was in fact several
days before he concluded to join in it. At length,
however, he consented, and immediately commenced
aiding Gilpin in making the necessary
preparations. He found a bit and bit-stock in
an old shop belonging to Mr. Kerber, near his
house, and also a chisel, which Gilpin said would
do for forcing open the desk. There was another
boy almost as old as Gilpin, who joined in the
plan. He was a coarse and rough boy, and was
generally called Griff. His real name was Christopher.</p>

<p>Gilpin and Griff gave Rodolphus a very large
share of the work of making the necessary preparations
for the theft. Their plan was to make
the attempt on Saturday night  They thought
that by this means a whole day would intervene
before the discovery would be made that the
money was gone, since Mr. Kerber would not be
likely to go to his office on Sunday. They would
thus, they thought, have ample time to take all
the necessary means for concealing their booty.
Rodolphus was to go to bed as usual, and then
to get up about ten o'clock, and come out of
his window, over the roofs, as he used to do at
home, and as he had very often done since he
came to Mr. Kerber's. The bit and bit-stock,
and the chisel were to be all ready in the shed,
beforehand. Rodolphus was to carry them there
some time in the course of the afternoon. On
descending from the roofs, Rodolphus was to go
to meet the other boys at a certain corn-barn,
which belonged to a house which had once been
a farm-house in the village.</p>

<p>A corn-barn is a small square building, standing
upon high posts at the four corners. These
posts are usually about four or five feet high.
The building is raised in this manner above the
ground, to prevent mice and other animals from
getting into it and eating the corn.</p>

<p>The corn-barn, however, at which the boys
were to meet, was not now used for the storage
of grain, but as a sort of lumber-room for a tavern
that stood near by. It was behind the tavern,
and almost out of sight of it, at the end of a narrow
lane. It was in a very secluded position.
The space beneath the building where the posts
were, had been boarded up on three sides, and
there were various old boxes and barrels underneath
it. Rodolphus and the other bad boys of the
village had often used this place as a rendezvous,
and had carried there the various things which
they had pilfered from time to time; and in summer
nights they would often meet there and stay
half the night, spending the time in eating and
drinking, and in gambling with cards or coppers,
and in other wicked amusements. There was
no floor but the ground, but the boys had carried
straw into the place, and spread it down where
they were accustomed to sit and lie, and this
made the place very comfortable.</p>

<p>The boys were to meet at this place at ten
o'clock. Griff was to bring a dark lantern. This
lantern was one which the boys had made themselves.
It was formed of a round block of wood
for the base, with a hole or socket in the middle
of it, for the admission of the end of the candle.
Around this block there had been rolled a strip of
pasteboard, so as to make of it a sort of round box,
with a wooden bottom and no top. The pasteboard
was kept in its place by a string, which
was wound several times around it. There was
a long hole cut in the pasteboard on one side,
for the light to shine out of. There was another
pasteboard roll which went over the whole, and
closed this opening when the boys wanted the
lantern to be perfectly dark.</p>

<p>The boys met at the place of rendezvous at
the time appointed. They then proceeded to the
stable. They got into the shed, and there struck
a light, and lighted a short candle which one of
the boys had in his pocket. Rodolphus held this
<a class="pagenum" id="page_591" title="pg 591"></a>
candle, while Gilpin, who was taller and stronger
than either of the other boys, bored the hole in
the door, in the place which Rodolphus indicated.
When the hole was bored, the boys inserted an
iron rod into it, and running this rod under the
hasp, they pried the hasp up and unfastened the
door. They opened the door, and then, to their
great joy, found themselves all safe in the office.</p>

<div class="figleft w50">
<img src="images/illo_06.jpg" width="100%"
alt="THUS"
title="THUS" />
<p class="center">THUS</p>
</div>

<p>They put the dark lantern down upon the table, and covered it with
its screen, and then listened, perfectly whist, a minute or two, to
be sure that nobody was coming.</p>

<p>"You go and watch at the shed-door," said Gilpin to Rodolphus, "while
we open the desk."</p>

<p>So Rodolphus went to the shed-door. He peeped out, and looked up and
down the village-street, but all was still.</p>

<p>Presently he heard a sort of splitting sound within the office, which
he knew was made by the forcing open of the lid of the desk. Very
soon afterward the boys came out, in a hurried
manner&mdash;&mdash;Griff had the lantern and Gilpin the box.</p>

<p>"Have you got it?" said Rodolphus.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Griff.</p>

<p>"Let's see," said Rodolphus.</p>

<p>Griff held out the box to Rodolphus. It was very heavy and they could
hear the sound of the money within. All three of the boys seemed
almost wild with trepidation and excitement. Griff however
immediately began to hurry them away, pulling the box from them and
saying, "Come, come, boys, we must not stay fooling here."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute till I hide the tools again?" said Rodolphus, "and
then we'll run."</p>

<p>Rodolphus hid the tools behind the wood-pile, in the shed, where they
had been before, and then the boys sallied forth into the street.
They crept along stealthily in the shadows of the houses and in the
most dark and obscure places, until they came to the tavern, where
they were to turn down the lane to the corn-barn. As soon as they got
safely to this lane, they felt relieved, and they walked on in a more
unconcerned manner; and when at length they got fairly in under the
corn-barn they felt perfectly secure.</p>

<p>"There," said Griff, "was not that well done?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Rodolphus, "and now all that we have got to do is to get
the box open."</p>

<p>"We can break it open with stones," said Griff.</p>

<p>"No," said Gilpin, "that will make too much noise. We will bury it
under this straw for a few days, and open it somehow or other
by-and-by, when they have given up looking for the box. You can get
the real key of it for us, Rodolphus, can't you?"</p>

<p>"How can I get it?" asked Rodolphus.</p>

<p>"Oh, you can contrive some way to get it from old Kerber, I've no
doubt. At any rate the best thing is to bury it now."</p>

<div class="figright w50">

title="THE CORN-BARN" />
<p class="center">THE CORN-BARN.</p>
</div>

<p>To this plan the boys all agreed. They pulled
away the straw, which was spread under the
corn-barn, and dug a hole in the ground beneath,
working partly with sticks and partly with their
fingers. When they had got the hole deep enough,
they put the box in and covered it up. Then
they spread the straw over the place as before.</p>

<p>During all this time the lantern had been standing
upon a box pretty near by, having been put
there by the boys, in order that the light might
shine down upon the place where they had been
digging. As soon as their work was done, the
boys went softly outside to see if the way was
clear for them to go home, leaving the lantern
on the box; and while they were standing at the
corner of the barn outside, looking up the lane,
and whispering together, they saw suddenly a
<a class="pagenum" id="page_592" title="pg 592"></a>
light beginning to gleam up from within. They
ran in and found that the lantern had fallen down,
and that the straw was all in a blaze. They immediately
began to tread upon the fire and try to
put it out, but the instant that they did so they
were all thunderstruck by the appearance of a
fourth person, who came rushing in among them
from the outside. They all screamed out with
terror and ran. Rodolphus separated from the
rest and crouched down a moment behind the
stone wall, but immediately afterward, feeling
that there would be no safety for him here, he
set off again and ran across some back fields and
gardens, in the direction toward Mr. Kerber's.
He looked back occasionally and found that the
light was rapidly increasing. Presently he began
to hear cries of fire. He ran on till he reached
the house; he scrambled over the fences into
the back yard, climbed up upon a shed, crept
along under the chimneys to the window of his
room, got in as fast as he could, undressed himself
and went to bed, and had just drawn the
clothes up over him, when he heard a loud knocking
at the door, and Mrs. Kerber's voice outside,
calling out to him, that there was a cry of fire
in the village, and that he must get up quick as
possible and help put it out.</p>

<h3>BY JOHN S. C. ABBOTT.</h3>

<h3>THE RETURN FROM EGYPT.</h3>

<p>The Expedition to Egypt was one of the most
magnificent enterprises which human ambition
ever conceived. The Return to France
combines still more, if possible, of the elements
of the moral sublime. But for the disastrous destruction
of the French fleet the plans of Napoleon,
in reference to the East, would probably
have been triumphantly successful. At least it
can not be doubted that a vast change would
have been effected throughout the Eastern world.
Those plans were now hopeless. The army was
isolated, and cut off from all reinforcements and
all supplies. The best thing which Napoleon
could do for his troops in Egypt was to return to
France, and exert his personal influence in sending
them succor. His return involved the continuance
of the most honorable devotion to those
soldiers whom he necessarily left behind him.
The secrecy of his departure was essential to its
success. Had the bold attempt been suspected,
it would certainly have been frustrated by the
increased vigilance of the English cruisers. The
intrepidity of the enterprise must elicit universal
admiration.</p>

<p>Contemplate, for a moment, the moral aspects
of this undertaking. A nation of thirty millions
of people, had been for ten years agitated by the
most terrible convulsions. There is no atrocity,
which the tongue can name, which had not desolated
the doomed land. Every passion which
can degrade the heart of fallen man, had swept
with simoom blast over the cities and the villages
of France. Conflagrations had laid the palaces
of the wealthy in ruins, and the green lawns
where their children had played, had been crimsoned
with the blood of fathers and sons, mothers
and daughters. A gigantic system of robbery
had seized upon houses and lands and every species
of property and had turned thousands of the
opulent out into destitution, beggary, and death.
Pollution had been legalized by the voice of God-defying
lust, and France, <i>la belle France</i>, had
been converted into a disgusting warehouse of
infamy. Law, with suicidal hand, had destroyed
itself, and the decisions of the legislature swayed
to and fro, in accordance with the hideous
clamors of the mob. The guillotine, with gutters
ever clotted with human gore, was the only argument
which anarchy condescended to use.
Effectually it silenced every remonstrating tongue.
Constitution after constitution had risen, like
mushrooms, in a night, and like mushrooms had
perished in a day. Civil war was raging with
bloodhound fury in France, Monarchists and Jacobins
grappling each other infuriate with despair.
The allied kings of Europe, who by their
alliance had fanned these flames of rage and ruin,
were gazing with terror upon the portentous
prodigy, and were surrounding France with their
navies and their armies.</p>

<p>The people had been enslaved for centuries by
the king and the nobles. Their oppression had
been execrable, and it had become absolutely unendurable.
"We, the millions," they exclaimed
in their rage, "will no longer minister to your
voluptuousness, and pride, and lust." "You
shall, you insolent dogs," exclaimed king and
nobles, "we heed not your barking." "You
shall," reiterated the Pope, in the portentous
thunderings of the Vatican. "You shall," came
echoed back from the palaces of Vienna, from
the dome of the Kremlin, from the seraglio of
the Turk, and, in tones deeper, stronger, more
resolute, from constitutional, liberty-loving, happy
England. Then was France a volcano, and its
lava-streams deluged Europe. The people were
desperate. In the blind fury of their frenzied
self-defense they lost all consideration. The
castles of the nobles were but the monuments
of past taxation and servitude. With yells of
hatred the infuriated populace razed them to the
ground. The palaces of the kings, where, for
uncounted centuries, dissolute monarchs had
reveled in enervating and heaven-forbidden pleasures,
were but national badges of the bondage
of the people. The indignant throng swept
through them, like a Mississippi inundation, leaving
upon marble floors, and cartooned walls and
ceilings, the impress of their rage. At one bound
France had passed from despotism to anarchy.
The kingly tyrant, with golden crown and iron
sceptre, surrounded by wealthy nobles and dissolute
beauties, had disappeared, and a many-headed
monster, rapacious and blood-thirsty,
vulgar and revolting, had emerged from mines
and workshops and the cellars of vice and penury,
like one of the spectres of fairy tales to fill
<a class="pagenum" id="page_593" title="pg 593"></a>
his place. France had passed from Monarchy,
not to healthy Republicanism, but to Jacobinism,
to the reign of the mob. Napoleon utterly abhorred
the tyranny of the king. He also utterly
abhorred the despotism of vulgar, violent, sanguinary
Jacobin misrule. The latter he regarded
with even far deeper repugnance than the former.
"I frankly confess," said Napoleon, again and
again, "that if I must choose between Bourbon
oppression, and mob violence, I infinitely prefer
the former."</p>

<p>Such had been the state of France, essentially,
for nearly ten years. The great mass of the
people were exhausted with suffering, and longed
for repose. The land was filled with plots and
counterplots. But there was no one man of sufficient
prominence to carry with him the nation.
The government was despised and disregarded.
France was in a state of chaotic ruin. Many
voices here and there, began to inquire "Where
is Bonaparte, the conqueror of Italy, the conqueror
of Egypt? He alone can save us." His
world-wide renown turned the eyes of the nation
to him as their only hope.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances Napoleon, then a
young man but twenty-nine years of age, and
who, but three years before, had been unknown
to fame or to fortune, resolved to return to France,
to overthrow the miserable government, by which
the country was disgraced, to subdue anarchy at
home and aggression from abroad, and to rescue
thirty millions of people from ruin. The enterprise
was undeniably magnificent in its grandeur
and noble in its object. He had two foes to encounter,
each formidable, the royalists of combined
Europe and the mob of Paris. The quiet
and undoubting self-confidence with which he
entered upon this enterprise, is one of the most
remarkable events in the whole of his extraordinary
career. He took with him no armies to
hew down opposition. He engaged in no deep-laid
and wide-spread conspiracy. Relying upon
the energies of his own mind, and upon the sympathies
of the great mass of the people, he went
alone, with but one or two companions, to whom
he revealed not his thoughts, to gather into his
hands the scattered reins of power. Never did
he encounter more fearful peril. The cruisers
of England, Russia, Turkey, of allied Europe in
arms against France, thronged the Mediterranean.
How could he hope to escape them? The guillotine
was red with blood. Every one who had
dared to oppose the mob had perished upon it.
How could Napoleon venture, single-handed, to
beard this terrible lion in his den?</p>

<p>It was ten o'clock at night, the 22d of August,
1799, when Napoleon ascended the sides of the
frigate Muiron, to sail for France. A few of his
faithful Guards, and eight companions, either
officers in the army or members of the scientific
corps, accompanied him. There were five hundred
soldiers on board the ships. The stars
shone brightly in the Syrian sky, and under their
soft light the blue waves of the Mediterranean
lay spread out most peacefully before them. The
frigates unfurled their sails. Napoleon, silent
and lost in thought, for a long time walked the
quarter deck of the ship, gazing upon the low
outline of Egypt as, in the dim starlight, it faded
away. His companions were intoxicated with
delight, in view of again returning to France.
Napoleon was neither elated nor depressed. Serene
and silent he communed with himself, and
whenever we can catch a glimpse of those secret
communings we find them always bearing the
impress of grandeur. Though Napoleon was in
the habit of visiting the soldiers at their camp
fires, of sitting down and conversing with them
with the greatest freedom and familiarity, the
majesty of his character overawed his officers,
and adoration and reserve blended with their
love. Though there was no haughtiness in his
demeanor, he habitually dwelt in a region of elevation
above them all. Their talk was of cards,
of wine, of pretty women. Napoleon's thoughts
were of empire, of renown, of moulding the destinies
of nations. They regarded him not as a
companion, but as a master, whose wishes they
loved to anticipate; for he would surely guide
them to wealth, and fame, and fortune. He contemplated
them, not as equals and confiding
friends, but as efficient and valuable instruments
for the accomplishment of his purposes. Murat
was to Napoleon a body of ten thousand horse-men,
ever ready for a resistless charge. Lannes
was a phalanx of infantry, bristling with bayonets,
which neither artillery nor cavalry could
batter down or break. Augereau was an armed
column of invincible troops, black, dense, massy,
impetuous, resistless, moving with gigantic tread
wherever the finger of the conqueror pointed.
These were but the members of Napoleon's body,
the limbs obedient to the mighty soul which
swayed them. They were not the companions
of his thoughts, they were only the servants of
his will. The number to be found with whom
the soul of Napoleon could dwell in sympathetic
friendship was few&mdash;very few.</p>

<p>
apoleon had formed a very low estimate of
human nature, and consequently made great allowance
for the infirmities incident to humanity.
Bourrienne reports him as saying, "Friendship
is but a name. I love no one; no, not even my
brothers. Joseph perhaps a little. And if I do
love him, it is from habit, and because he is my
elder. Duroc! Ah, yes! I love him too. But
why? His character pleases me. He is cold,
reserved, and resolute, and I really believe that
he never shed a tear. As to myself, I know well
that I have not one true friend. As long as I
continue what I am, I may have as many pretended
friends as I please. We must leave sensibility
to the women. It is their business. Men
should be firm in heart and in purpose, or they
should have nothing to do with war or government.
I am not amiable. No; I am not amiable
I never have been. But I am just."</p>

<p>In another mood of mind, more tender, more
subdued, he remarked, at St. Helena, in reply to
Las Casas, who with great severity was condemning
those who abandoned Napoleon in his
hour of adversity: "You are not acquainted with
<a class="pagenum" id="page_594" title="pg 594"></a>
men. They are difficult to comprehend if one
wishes to be strictly just. Can they understand
or explain even their own characters? Almost
all those who abandoned me would, had I continued
to be prosperous, never perhaps have dreamed
of their own defection. There are vices and virtues
which depend upon circumstances. Our last
trials were beyond all human strength! Besides
I was forsaken rather than betrayed; there was
more of weakness than of perfidy around me. <i>It
was the denial of St. Peter.</i> Tears and penitence
are probably at hand, And where will you find
in the page of history any one possessing a greater
number of friends and partisans? Who was ever
more popular and more beloved? Who was ever
more ardently and deeply regretted? Here, from
this very rock, on viewing the present disorders
in France, who would not be tempted to say that
I still reign there? No; human nature might
have appeared in a more odious light."</p>

<p>Las Casas, who shared with Napoleon his
weary years of imprisonment at St. Helena, says
of him: "He views the complicated circumstances
of his fall from so high a point that individuals
escape his notice. He never evinces
the least symptom of virulence toward those of
whom it might be supposed he has the greatest
reason to complain. His strongest mark of reprobation,
and I have had frequent occasions to
notice it, is to preserve silence with respect to
them whenever they are mentioned in his presence.
But how often has he been heard to restrain
the violent and less reserved expressions
of those about him?"</p>

<p>"And here I must observe," says Las Casas,
"that since I have become acquainted with the
Emperor's character, I have never known him to
evince, for a single moment, the least feeling of
anger or animosity against those who had most
deeply injured him. He speaks of them coolly
and without resentment, attributing their conduct,
in some measure, to the perplexing circumstances
in which they were placed, and throwing the rest
to the account of human weakness."</p>

<p>Marmont, who surrendered Paris to the allies,
was severely condemned by Las Casas. Napoleon
replied: "Vanity was his ruin. Posterity
will justly cast a shade upon his character, yet
his heart will be more valued than the memory
of his career." "Your attachment for Berthier,"
said Las Casas, "surprised us. He was full of
pretensions and pride." "Berthier was not without
talent," Napoleon replied, "and I am far from
wishing to disavow his merit, or my partiality;
but he was so undecided!" "He was very harsh
and overbearing," Las Casas rejoined. "And
what, my dear Las Casas," Napoleon replied,
"is more overbearing than weakness which feels
itself protected by strength? Look at women,
for example." This Berthier had, with the utmost
meanness, abandoned his benefactor, and took
his place in front of the carriage of Louis XVIII.
as he rode triumphantly into Paris. "The only
revenge I wish on this poor Berthier," said Napoleon
at the time, "would be to see him in his costume
of captain of the body-guard of Louis."</p>

<p>Says Bourrienne, Napoleon's rejected secretary,
"The character of Napoleon was not a cruel
one. He was neither rancorous nor vindictive.
None but those who are blinded by fury, could
have given him the name of Nero or Caligula.
I think that I have stated his real faults with sufficient
sincerity to be believed upon my word. I
can assert that Bonaparte, apart from politics,
was feeling, kind, and accessible to pity. He was
very fond of children, and a bad man has seldom
that disposition. In the habits of private life he
had, and the expression is not too strong, much
benevolence and great indulgence for human
weakness. A contrary opinion is too firmly fixed
in some minds for me to hope to remove it. I
shall, I fear, have opposers; but I address myself
to those who are in search of truth. I lived in
the most unreserved confidence with Napoleon
until the age of thirty-four years, and I advance
nothing lightly." This is the admission of one
who had been ejected from office by Napoleon,
and who had become a courtier of the reinstated
Bourbons. It is a candid admission of an enemy.</p>

<p>The ships weighed anchor in the darkness of
the night, hoping before the day should dawn to
escape the English cruisers which were hovering
about Alexandria. Unfortunately, at midnight,
the wind died away, and it became almost perfectly
calm. Fearful of being captured, some
were anxious to seek again the shore. "Be
quiet," said Napoleon, "we shall pass in safety."</p>

<p>Admiral Gantheaume wished to take the shortest
route to France. Napoleon, however, directed
the admiral to sail along as near as possible to
the coast of Africa, and to continue that unfrequented
route, till the ships should pass the Island
of Sardinia. "In the mean while," said he,
"should an English fleet present itself, we will
run ashore upon the sands, and march, with the
handful of brave men and the few pieces of artillery
we have with us, to Oran or Tunis, and
there find means to re-embark." Thus Napoleon,
in this hazardous enterprise, braved every peril.
The most imminent and the most to be dreaded
of all, was captivity in an English prison. For
twenty days the wind was so invariably adverse,
that the ships did not advance three hundred
miles. Many were so discouraged and so apprehensive
of capture that it was even proposed to
return to Alexandria. Napoleon was much in
the habit of peaceful submission to that which he
could not remedy. During all these trying weeks
he appeared perfectly serene and contented. To
the murmuring of his companions he replied,
"We shall arrive in France in safety. I am determined
to proceed at all hazards. Fortune will
not abandon us." "People frequently speak,"
says Bourrienne, who accompanied Napoleon
upon this voyage, "of the good fortune which
attaches to an individual, and even attends him
through life. Without professing to believe in
this sort of predestination, yet, when I call to
mind the numerous dangers which Bonaparte
escaped in so many enterprises, the hazards he
encountered, the chances he ran, I can conceive
that others may have this faith. But having for
<a class="pagenum" id="page_595" title="pg 595"></a>
a length of time studied the 'man of destiny,' I
have remarked that what was called his fortune
was, in reality, his genius; that his success was
the consequence of his admirable foresight&mdash;of
his calculations, rapid as lightning, and of the
conviction that boldness is often the truest wisdom.
If, for example, during our voyage from
Egypt to France, he had not imperiously insisted
upon pursuing a course different from that usually
taken, and which usual course was recommended
by the admiral, would he have escaped
the perils which beset his path? Probably not.
And was all this the effect of chance? Certainly
not."</p>

<p class="center">THE RETURN VOYAGE.</p>
</div>

<p>During these days of suspense, Napoleon, apparently
as serene in spirit as the calm which
often silvered the unrippled surface of the sea,
held all the energies of his mind in perfect control.
A choice library he invariably took with
him wherever he went. He devoted the hours
to writing, study, finding recreation in solving
the most difficult problems in geometry, and in
investigating chemistry and other scientific subjects
of practical utility. He devoted much time
to conversation with the distinguished scholars
whom he had selected to accompany him. His
whole soul seemed engrossed in the pursuit of
literary and scientific attainments. He also
carefully, and with most intense interest, studied
the Bible and the Koran, scrutinizing, with
the eye of a philosopher, the antagonistic systems
of the Christian and the Moslem. The
stupidity of the Koran wearied him. The sublimity
of the Scriptures charmed him. He read
again and again, with deep admiration, Christ's
sermon upon the mount, and called his companions,
from their card-tables, to read it to them,
that they might also appreciate its moral beauty
and its eloquence. "You will, ere long, become
devout yourself," said one of his infidel companions.
"I wish I might become so," Napoleon
replied. "What a solace Christianity must be
to one who has an undoubting conviction of its
truth." But practical Christianity he had only
seen in the mummeries of the papal church. Remembering
the fasts, the vigils, the penances,
the cloisters, the scourgings of a corrupt Christianity,
and contrasting them with the voluptuous
paradise and the sensual houries which inflamed
the eager vision of the Moslem, he once
exclaimed, in phrase characteristic of his genius,
"The religion of Jesus is a threat, that of Mohammed
a promise." The religion of Jesus is not
a threat. Though the wrath of God shall fall
upon the children of disobedience, our Saviour
invites us, in gentle accents, to the green pastures
and the still waters of the Heavenly Canaan;
to cities resplendent with pearls and gold;
to mansions of which God is the architect; to
the songs of seraphim, and the flight of cherubim,
exploring on tireless pinion, the wonders of infinity;
to peace of conscience, and rapture dwelling
in the pure heart, and to blest companionship
loving and beloved; to majesty of person and
loftiness of intellect; to appear as children and
as nobles in the audience-chamber of God; to an
immortality of bliss. No! the religion of Jesus
is not a threat, though it has too often been thus
represented by its mistaken or designing advocates.</p>

<p>One evening a group of officers were conversing
together, upon the quarter deck, respecting
the existence of God. Many of them believed
not in his being. It was a calm, cloudless, brilliant
night. The heavens, the work of God's fingers,
canopied them gloriously. The moon and
the stars, which God had ordained, beamed down
upon them with serene lustre. As they were
flippantly giving utterance to the arguments of
atheism, Napoleon paced to and fro upon the
deck, taking no part in the conversation, and apparently
absorbed in his own thoughts. Suddenly
he stopped before them and said, in those
tones of dignity which ever overawed, "Gentlemen,
your arguments are very fine. But who
made all those worlds, beaming so gloriously
above us? Can you tell me that?" No one answered.
Napoleon resumed his silent walk, and
the officers selected another topic for conversation.
<a class="pagenum" id="page_596" title="pg 596"></a></p>

<p class="center">NAPOLEON AND THE ATHEISTS.</p>
</div>

<p>In these intense studies Napoleon first began
to appreciate the beauty and the sublimity of
Christianity. Previously to this, his own strong
sense had taught him the principles of a noble
toleration; and Jew, Christian, and Moslem stood
equally regarded before him. Now he began to
apprehend the surpassing excellence of Christianity.
And though the cares of the busiest
life through which a mortal has ever passed
soon engrossed his energies, this appreciation
and admiration of the gospel of Christ, visibly
increased with each succeeding year. He unflinchingly
braved the scoffs of infidel Europe, in
re-establishing the Christian religion in paganized
France. He periled his popularity with the
army, and disregarded the opposition of his most
influential friends, from his deep conviction of
the importance of religion to the welfare of the
state. With the inimitable force of his own
glowing eloquence, he said to Montholon, at St.
Helena, "I know men, and I tell you that Jesus
Christ is not a man! The religion of Christ is
a mystery, which subsists by its own force, and
proceeds from a mind which is not a human mind.
We find in it a marked individuality which originated
a train of words and maxims unknown
before. Jesus borrowed nothing from our knowledge.
He exhibited himself the perfect example
of his precepts. Jesus is not a philosopher; for
his proofs are his miracles, and from the first his
disciples adored him. In fact, learning and philosophy
are of no use for salvation; and Jesus came
into the world to reveal the mysteries of heaven
and the laws of the spirit. Alexander, C&aelig;sar,
Charlemagne, and myself have founded empires.
But upon what did we rest the creations of our
genius? upon <i>force</i>. Jesus Christ alone founded
his empire upon love. And at this moment millions
of men would die for him. I die before my
time, and my body will be given back to earth,
to become food for worms. Such is the fate of
him who has been called the great Napoleon.
What an abyss between my deep misery and the
eternal kingdom of Christ, which is proclaimed,
loved, and adored, and which is extending over
the whole earth! Call you this dying? Is it
not living rather? The death of Christ is the
death of a God!"</p>

<p>At the time of the invasion of Egypt, Napoleon
regarded all forms of religion with equal respect.
And though he considered Christianity superior,
in intellectuality and refinement, to all other
<a class="pagenum" id="page_597" title="pg 597"></a>
modes of worship, he did not consider any religion
as of divine origin. At one time, speaking
of the course which he pursued in Egypt, he
said, "Such was the disposition of the army, that
in order to induce them to listen to the bare mention
of religion, I was obliged to speak very
lightly on the subject; to place Jews beside
Christians, and rabbis beside bishops. But after
all it would not have been so very extraordinary
had circumstances induced me to embrace Islamism.
But I must have had good reasons for my
conversion. I must have been secure of advancing
at least as far as the Euphrates. Change
of religion for private interest is inexcusable.
But it may be pardoned in consideration of immense
political results. Henry IV. said, <i>Paris
is well worth a mass</i>. Will it then be said that
the dominion of the East, and perhaps the subjugation
of all Asia, were not worth a <i>turban
and a pair of trowsers</i>? And in truth the whole
matter was reduced to this. The sheiks had
studied how to render it easy to us. They had
smoothed down the great obstacles, allowed us
the use of wine, and dispensed with all corporeal
formalities. We should have lost only our
small-clothes and hats."</p>

<p>Of the infidel Rousseau, Napoleon ever spoke
in terms of severe reprobation. "He was a bad
man, a very bad man," said he, "he caused the
revolution." "I was not aware," another replied,
"that you considered the French Revolution
such an unmixed evil." "Ah," Napoleon
rejoined, "you wish to say that without the revolution
you would not have had me. Nevertheless,
without the revolution France would have
been more happy." When invited to visit the
hermitage of Rousseau, to see his cap, table, great
chair, &amp;c., he exclaimed, "Bah! I have no taste
for such fooleries. Show them to my brother
Louis. He is worthy of them."</p>

<p>Probably the following remarks of Napoleon,
made at St. Helena, will give a very correct idea
of his prevailing feelings upon the subject of
religion. "The sentiment of religion is so consolatory,
that it must be considered a gift from
Heaven. What a resource would it not be for us
here, to possess it. What rewards have I not
a right to expect, who have run a career so extraordinary,
so tempestuous, as mine has been,
without committing a single crime. And yet
how many might I not have been guilty of? I
can appear before the tribunal of God, I can
await his judgment, without fear. He will not
find my conscience stained with the thoughts of
murder and poisonings; with the infliction of
violent and premeditated deaths, events so common
in the history of those whose lives resemble
mine. I have wished only for the power, the
greatness, the glory of France. All my faculties,
all my efforts, all my movements, were directed
to the attainment of that object. These can not
be crimes. To me they appeared acts of virtue.
What then would be my happiness, if the bright
prospect of futurity presented itself to crown the
last moments of my existence."</p>

<p>After a moment's pause, in which he seemed lost
in thought, he resumed: "But, how is it possible
that conviction can find its way to our hearts,
when we hear the absurd language, and witness
the iniquitous conduct of the greater part of
those whose business it is to preach to us. I
am surrounded by priests, who repeat incessantly
that their reign is not of this world; and yet
they lay their hands upon every thing which
they can get. The Pope is the head of that religion
which is from Heaven. What did the
present chief pontiff, who is undoubtedly a good
and a holy man, not offer, to be allowed to return
to Rome. The surrender of the government of
the church, of the institution of bishops was not
too much for him to give, to become once more
a secular prince.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless," he continued, after another
thoughtful pause, "it can not be doubted that,
as emperor, the species of incredulity which I
felt was beneficial to the nations I had to govern.
How could I have favored equally sects so opposed
to one another, if I had joined any one of
them? How could I have preserved the independence
of my thoughts and of my actions under
the control of a confessor, who would have
governed me under the dread of hell!" Napoleon
closed this conversation, by ordering the
New Testament to be brought. Commencing
at the beginning, he read aloud as far as the
conclusion of our Saviour's address to his disciples
upon the mountain. He expressed himself
struck with the highest admiration, in contemplating
its purity, its sublimity, and the
beautiful perfection of its moral code.</p>

<p>For forty days the ships were driven about by
contrary winds, and on the 1st of October they
made the island of Corsica, and took refuge in
the harbor of Ajaccio. The tidings that Napoleon
had landed in his native town swept over
the island like a gale, and the whole population
crowded to the port to catch a sight of their
illustrious countryman. "It seemed," said Napoleon,
"that half of the inhabitants had discovered
traces of kindred." But a few years had
elapsed since the dwelling of Madame Letitia
was pillaged by the mob, and the whole Bonaparte
family, in penury and friendlessness, were
hunted from their home, effecting their escape
in an open boat by night. Now, the name of
Bonaparte filled the island with acclamations.
But Napoleon was alike indifferent to such unjust
censure, and to such unthinking applause.
As the curse did not depress, neither did the
hosanna elate.</p>

<p>After the delay of a few days in obtaining
supplies, the ships again weighed anchor, on the
7th of October, and continued their perilous voyage.
The evening of the next day, as the sun
was going down in unusual splendor, there appeared
in the west, painted in strong relief against
his golden rays, an English squadron. The admiral,
who saw from the enemy's signals that
he was observed, urged an immediate return to
Corsica. Napoleon, convinced that capture would
be the result of such a man&oelig;uvre, exclaimed,
"To do so would be to take the road to England."
<a class="pagenum" id="page_598" title="pg 598"></a>
I am seeking that to France. Spread all sail.
Let every one be at his post. Steer to the northwest.
Onward." The night was dark, the wind
fair. Rapidly the ships were approaching the
coast of France, through the midst of the hostile
squadron, and exposed to the most imminent
danger of capture. Escape seemed impossible.
It was a night of fearful apprehension and terror
to all on board, excepting Napoleon. He determined,
in case of extremity, to throw himself
into a boat, and trust for safety to darkness
and the oars. With the most perfect self-possession
and composure of spirits, he ordered the
long-boat to be prepared, selected those whom
he desired to accompany him, and carefully collected
such papers as he was anxious to preserve.
Not an eye was closed during the night. It was
indeed a fearful question to be decided. Are
these weary wanderers, in a few hours, to be in
the embrace of their wives and their children, or
will the next moment show them the black hull
of an English man-of-war, emerging from the
gloom, to consign them to lingering years of
captivity in an English prison? In this terrible
hour no one could perceive that the composure
of Napoleon was in the slightest degree ruffled.
The first dawn of the morning revealed to their
straining vision the hills of France stretching
along but a few leagues before them, and far
away, in the northeast, the hostile squadron, disappearing
beneath the horizon of the sea. The
French had escaped. The wildest bursts of joy
rose from the ships. But Napoleon gazed calmly
upon his beloved France, with pale cheek and
marble brow, too proud to manifest emotion. At
eight o'clock in the morning the four vessels
dropped anchor in the little harbor of Frejus.
It was the morning of the 8th of October. Thus
for fifty days Napoleon had been tossed upon the
waves of the Mediterranean, surrounded by the
hostile fleets of England, Russia, and Turkey,
and yet had eluded their vigilance.</p>

<p>This wonderful passage of Napoleon, gave
rise to many caricatures, both in England and
France. One of these caricatures, which was
conspicuous in the London shop windows, possessed
so much point and historic truth, that
Napoleon is said to have laughed most heartily
on seeing it. Lord Nelson, as is well known,
with all his heroism, was not exempt from the
frailties of humanity. The British admiral was
represented as guarding Napoleon. Lady Hamilton
makes her appearance, and his lordship
becomes so engrossed in caressing the fair enchantress,
that Napoleon escapes between his
legs. This was hardly a caricature. It was
almost historic verity. While Napoleon was
struggling against adverse storms off the coast
of Africa, Lord Nelson, adorned with the laurels
of his magnificent victory, in fond dalliance with
his frail Delilah, was basking in the courts of
voluptuous and profligate kings. "No one,"
said Napoleon, "can surrender himself to the
dominion of love, without the forfeiture of some
palms of glory."</p>

<p class="center">THE LANDING AT FREJUS.</p>
</div>

<p>When the four vessels entered the harbor of
Frejus, a signal at the mast-head of the Muiron
informed the authorities on shore that Napoleon
was on board. The whole town was instantly
in commotion. Before the anchors were dropped
the harbor was filled with boats, and the ships
were surrounded with an enthusiastic multitude,
climbing their sides, thronging their decks, and
rending the air with their acclamations.  All the
<a class="pagenum" id="page_599" title="pg 599"></a>
laws of quarantine were disregarded. The people,
weary of anarchy, and trembling in view of
the approaching Austrian invasion, were almost
delirious with delight in receiving thus, as it
were from the clouds, a deliverer, in whose potency
they could implicitly trust. When warned
that the ships had recently sailed from Alexandria,
and that there was imminent danger that
the plague might be communicated, they replied,
"We had rather have the plague than the Austrians."
Breaking over all the municipal regulations
of health, the people took Napoleon, almost
by violence, hurried him over the side of the ship
to the boats, and conveyed him in triumph to
the shore. The tidings had spread from farm-house
to farm-house with almost electric speed,
and the whole country population, men, women,
and children, were crowding down to the shore.
Even the wounded soldiers in the hospital, left
their cots and crawled to the beach, to get a
sight of the hero. The throng became so great
that it was with difficulty that Napoleon could
land. The gathering multitude, however, opened
to the right and the left, and Napoleon passed
through them, greeted with the enthusiastic cries
of "Long live the conqueror of Italy, the conqueror
of Egypt, the liberator of France." The
peaceful little harbor of Frejus was suddenly
thrown into a state of the most unheard of excitement.
The bells rang their merriest peels.
The guns in the forts rolled forth their heaviest
thunders over the hills and over the waves; and
the enthusiastic shouts of the ever increasing
multitudes, thronging Napoleon, filled the air.
The ships brought the first tidings of the wonderful
victories of Mount Tabor and of Aboukir.
The French, humiliated by defeat, were exceedingly
elated by this restoration of the national
honor. The intelligence of Napoleon's arrival
was immediately communicated, by telegraph, to
Paris, which was six hundred miles from Frejus.</p>

<p>When the tidings of Napoleon's landing at Frejus,
arrived in Paris, on the evening of the 9th of
October, Josephine was at a large party at the
house of M. Gohier, President of the Directory.
All the most distinguished men of the metropolis
were there. The intelligence produced the most
profound sensation. Some, rioting in the spoils
of office, turned pale with apprehension; knowing
well the genius of Napoleon, and his boundless
popularity, they feared another revolution, which
should eject them from their seats of power.
Others were elated with hope; they felt that
Providence had sent to France a deliverer, at the
very moment when a deliverer was needed. One
of the deputies, who had been deeply grieved at
the disasters which were overwhelming the Republic,
actually died of joy, when he heard of
Napoleon's return. Josephine, intensely excited
by the sudden and totally unexpected announcement,
immediately withdrew, hastened home, and
at midnight, without allowing an hour for repose,
she entered her carriage, with Louis Bonaparte
and Hortense, who subsequently became the
bride of Louis, and set out to meet her husband.
Napoleon almost at the same hour, with his suite,
left Frejus. During every step of his progress
he was greeted with the most extraordinary demonstrations
of enthusiasm and affection. Bonfires
blazed from the hills, triumphal arches,
hastily constructed, spanned his path. Long
lines of maidens spread a carpet of flowers for
his chariot wheels, and greeted him with smiles
and choruses of welcome. He arrived at Lyons
in the evening. The whole city was brilliant
with illuminations. An immense concourse surrounded
him with almost delirious shouts of joy.
The constituted authorities received him as he
descended from his carriage. The mayor had
prepared a long and eulogistic harangue for the
occasion. Napoleon had no time to listen to it.
With a motion of his hand, imposing silence, he
said, "Gentlemen, I learned that France was in
peril, I therefore did not hesitate to leave my
army in Egypt, that I might come to her rescue.
I now go hence. In a few days, if you think fit
to wait upon me, I shall be at leisure to hear
you." Fresh horses were by this time attached
to the carriages, and the cavalcade, which like a
meteor had burst upon them, like a meteor disappeared.
From Lyons, for some unexplained
reason, Napoleon turned from the regular route
to Paris and took a less frequented road. When
Josephine arrived at Lyons, to her utter consternation
she found that Napoleon had left the city,
several hours before her arrival, and that they
had passed each other by different roads. Her
anguish was inexpressible. For many months
she had not received a line from her idolized
husband, all communication having been intercepted
by the English cruisers. She knew that
many, jealous of her power, had disseminated,
far and wide, false reports respecting her conduct.
She knew that these, her enemies, would
surround Napoleon immediately upon his arrival,
and take advantage of her absence to inflame
his mind against her. Lyons is 245 miles from
Paris. Josephine had passed over those weary
leagues of hill and dale, pressing on without
intermission, by day and by night, alighting not
for refreshment or repose. Faint, exhausted,
and her heart sinking within her with fearful
apprehensions of the hopeless alienation of her
husband, she received the dreadful tidings that
she had missed him. There was no resource
left her but to retrace her steps with the utmost
possible celerity. Napoleon would, however,
have been one or two days in Paris before Josephine
could, by any possibility, re-enter the city.
Probably in all France, there was not, at that
time, a more unhappy woman than Josephine.</p>

<p>Secret wretchedness was also gnawing at the
heart of Napoleon. Who has yet fathomed the
mystery of human love? Intensest love and intensest
hate can, at the same moment, intertwine
their fibres in inextricable blending. In nothing
is the will so impotent as in guiding or checking
the impulses of this omnipotent passion. Napoleon
loved Josephine with that almost superhuman
energy which characterized all the movements
of his impetuous spirit. The stream did not fret
and ripple over a shallow bed, but it was serene
<a class="pagenum" id="page_600" title="pg 600"></a>
in its unfathomable depths. The world contained
but two objects for Napoleon, glory and Josephine;
glory first, and then, closely following, the
more substantial idol.</p>

<p>Many of the Parisian ladies, proud of a more
exalted lineage than Josephine could boast, were
exceedingly envious of the supremacy she had
attained in consequence of the renown of her
husband. Her influence over Napoleon was well
known. Philosophers, statesmen, ambitious generals,
all crowded her saloons, paying her homage.
A favorable word from Josephine they knew would
pave the way for them to fame and fortune. Thus
Josephine, from the saloons of Paris, with milder
radiance, reflected back the splendor of her husband.
She, solicitous of securing as many friends
as possible, to aid him in future emergencies, was
as diligent in "winning hearts" at home, as Napoleon
was in conquering provinces abroad. The
gracefulness of Josephine, her consummate delicacy
of moral appreciation, her exalted intellectual
gifts, the melodious tones of her winning
voice, charmed courtiers, philosophers, and statesmen
alike. Her saloons were ever crowded. Her
entertainments were ever embellished by the
presence of all who were illustrious in rank and
power in the metropolis. And in whatever circles
she appeared the eyes of the gentlemen first
sought for her. Two resistless attractions drew
them. She was peculiarly fascinating in person
and in character, and, through her renowned
husband, she could dispense the most precious
gifts. It is not difficult to imagine the envy
which must thus have been excited. Many a
haughty duchess was provoked, almost beyond
endurance, that Josephine, the untitled daughter
of a West Indian planter, should thus engross
the homage of Paris, while she, with her proud
rank, her wit, and her beauty, was comparatively
a cipher. Moreau's wife, in particular, resented
the supremacy of Josephine as a personal affront.
She thought General Moreau entitled to as much
consideration as General Bonaparte. By the
jealousy, rankling in her own bosom, she finally
succeeded in rousing her husband to conspire
against Napoleon, and thus the hero of Hohenlinden
was ruined. Some of the brothers and
sisters of Napoleon were also jealous of the paramount
influence of Josephine, and would gladly
wrest a portion of it from her hands. Under these
circumstances, in various ways, slanders had been
warily insinuated into the ears of Napoleon,
respecting the conduct of his wife. Conspiring
enemies became more and more bold. Josephine
was represented as having forgotten her husband,
as reveling exultant with female vanity, in general
flirtation; and, finally, as guilty of gross infidelity.
Nearly all the letters written by Napoleon
and Josephine to each other, were intercepted
by the English cruisers. Though Napoleon did
not credit these charges in full, he cherished not
a little of the pride, which led the Roman monarch
to exclaim, "C&aelig;sar's wife must not be suspected."</p>

<p>
apoleon was in this troubled state of mind
during the latter months of his residence in Egypt.
One day he was sitting alone in his tent, which
was pitched in the great Arabian desert. Several
months had passed since he had heard a
word from Josephine. Years might elapse ere
they would meet again. Junot entered, having
just received, through some channel of jealousy
and malignity, communications from Paris. Cautiously,
but fully, he unfolded the whole budget
of Parisian gossip. Josephine had found, as he
represented, in the love of others an ample recompense
for the absence of her husband. She
was surrounded by admirers with whom she was
engaged in an incessant round of intrigues and
flirtations. Regardless of honor she had surrended
herself to the dominion of passion. Napoleon
was for a few moments in a state of terrible
agitation. With hasty strides, like a chafed
lion, he paced his tent, exclaiming, "Why do I
love that woman so? Why can I not tear her
image from my heart? I will do so. I will have
an immediate and an open divorce&mdash;open and
public divorce." He immediately wrote to Josephine,
in terms of the utmost severity, accusing
her of "playing the coquette with half the world."
The letter escaped the British cruisers, and she
received it. It almost broke her faithful heart.
Such were the circumstances under which Napoleon
and Josephine were to meet after an absence
of eighteen months. Josephine was exceedingly
anxious to see Napoleon before he
should have an interview with her enemies.
Hence the depth of anguish with which she
heard that her husband had passed her. Two
or three days must elapse ere she could possibly
retrace the weary miles over which she had already
traveled.</p>

<p>In the mean time the carriage of Napoleon
was rapidly approaching the metropolis. By
night his path was brilliant with bonfires and
illuminations. The ringing of bells, the thunders
of artillery, and the acclamations of the multitude,
accompanied him every step of his way. But no
smile of triumph played upon his pale and pensive
cheeks. He felt that he was returning to a
desolated home. Gloom reigned in his heart.
He entered Paris, and drove rapidly to his own
dwelling. Behold, Josephine was not there.
Conscious guilt, he thought, had made her afraid
to meet him. It is in vain to attempt to penetrate
the hidden anguish of Napoleon's soul.
That his proud spirit must have suffered intensity
of woe, no one can doubt. The bitter enemies
of Josephine immediately surrounded him, eagerly
taking advantage of her absence, to inflame, to a
still higher degree, by adroit insinuations, his
jealousy and anger. Eugene had accompanied
him in his return from Egypt, and his affectionate
heart ever glowed with love and admiration for
his mother. With anxiety, amounting to anguish,
he watched at the window for her arrival.
Said one to Napoleon, maliciously endeavoring
to prevent the possibility of reconciliation, "Josephine
will appear before you, with all her fascinations.
She will explain matters. You will
forgive all, and tranquillity will be restored."
"Never!" exclaimed Napoleon, with pallid cheek
<a class="pagenum" id="page_601" title="pg 601"></a>
and trembling lip, striding nervously to and fro,
through the room, "never! I forgive! never!"
Then stopping suddenly, and gazing the interlocutor
wildly in the face, he exclaimed, with
passionate gesticulation, "You know me. Were
I not sure of my resolution, I would tear out this
heart, and cast it into the fire."</p>

<p>How strange is the life of the heart of man.
From this interview, Napoleon, two hours after
his arrival in Paris, with his whole soul agitated
by the tumult of domestic woe, went to the palace
of the Luxembourg, to visit the Directory, to
form his plans for the overthrow of the government
of France. Pale, pensive, joyless, his inflexible
purposes of ambition wavered not&mdash;his
iron energies yielded not. Josephine was an
idol. He execrated her and he adored her. He
loved her most passionately. He hated her most
virulently. He could clasp her one moment to
his bosom with burning kisses; the next moment
he would spurn her from him as the most loathsome
wretch. But glory was a still more cherished
idol, at whose shrine he bowed with unwavering
adoration. He strove to forget his
domestic wretchedness by prosecuting, with new
vigor, his schemes of grandeur. As he ascended
the stairs of the Luxembourg, some of the guard,
who had been with him in Italy, recognized his
person, and he was instantly greeted, with enthusiastic
shouts, "Long live Bonaparte." The
clamor rolled like a voice of thunder through the
spacious halls of the palace, and fell, like a death
knell, upon the ears of the Directors. The populace,
upon the pavement, caught the sound and
reechoed it from street to street. The plays at
the theatres, and the songs at the Opera, were
stopped, that it might be announced, from the
stage, that Bonaparte had arrived in Paris. Men,
women, and children simultaneously rose to their
feet, and a wild burst of enthusiastic joy swelled
upon the night air. All Paris was in commotion.
The name of Bonaparte was upon every lip. The
enthusiasm was contagious. Illuminations began
to blaze, here and there, without concert,
from the universal rejoicing, till the whole city
was resplendent with light. One bell rang forth
its merry peal of greeting, and then another, and
another, till every steeple was vocal with its
clamorous welcome. One gun was heard, rolling
its heavy thunders over the city. It was the
signal for an instantaneous, tumultuous roar,
from artillery and musketry, from all the battalions
in the metropolis. The tidings of the great
victories of Aboukir and Mount Tabor, reached
Paris with Napoleon. Those Oriental names
were shouted through the streets, and blazed
upon the eyes of the delighted people in letters
of light. Thus in an hour the whole of Paris
was thrown into a delirium of joy, and, without
any previous arrangements, there was displayed
the most triumphant and gorgeous festival.</p>

<p>The government of France was at this time
organized somewhat upon the model of that of
the United States. Instead of one President,
they had five, called Directors. Their Senate
was called The House of Ancients; their House
of Representatives, The Council of Five Hundred.
The five Directors, as might have been expected,
were ever quarreling among themselves,
each wishing for the lion's share of power. The
Monarchist, the Jacobin, and the moderate Republican
could not harmoniously co-operate in government.
They only circumvented each other,
while the administration sank into disgrace and
ruin. The Abb&eacute; Sieyes was decidedly the most
able man of the Executive. He was a proud patrician,
and his character may be estimated from
the following anecdote, which Napoleon has related
respecting him:</p>

<p>"The abb&eacute;, before the revolution, was chaplain
to one of the princesses. One day, when
he was performing mass before herself, her attendants,
and a large congregation, something occurred
which rendered it necessary for the princess
to leave the room. The ladies in waiting
and the nobility, who attended church more out
of complaisance to her than from any sense of
religion, followed her example. Sieyes was very
busy reading his prayers, and, for a few moments,
he did not perceive their departure. At last,
raising his eyes from his book, behold the princess,
the nobles, and all the ton had disappeared.
With an air of displeasure and contempt he shut
the book, and descended from the pulpit, exclaiming,
'I do not read prayers for the rabble.' He
immediately went out of the chapel, leaving the
service half-finished."</p>

<p>
apoleon arrived in Paris on the evening of the
17th of October, 1799. Two days and two nights
elapsed, ere Josephine was able to retrace the
weary leagues over which she had passed. It
was the hour of midnight on the 19th, when the
rattle of her carriage-wheels was heard entering
the court-yard of their dwelling in the Rue
Chanteraine. Eugene, anxiously awaiting her
arrival, was instantly at his mother's side, folding
her in his embrace. Napoleon also heard the
arrival, but he remained sternly in his chamber.
He had ever been accustomed to greet Josephine
at the door of her carriage, even when she returned
from an ordinary morning ride. No matter
what employments engrossed his mind, no
matter what guests were present, he would immediately
leave every thing, and hasten to the
door to assist Josephine to alight and to accompany
her into the house. But now, after an absence
of eighteen months, the faithful Josephine,
half-dead with exhaustion, was at the door, and
Napoleon, with pallid cheek and compressed lip,
and jealousy rankling in his bosom, remained
sternly in his room, preparing to overwhelm her
with his indignation.</p>

<p>Josephine was in a state of terrible agitation.
Her limbs tottered and her heart throbbed most
violently. Assisted by Eugene, and accompanied
by Hortense, she tremblingly ascended the stairs
to the little parlor where she had so often received
the caresses of her most affectionate
spouse. She opened the door. There stood
Napoleon, as immovable as a statue, leaning
against the mantle, with his arms folded across
his breast. Sternly and silently, he cast a withering
<a class="pagenum" id="page_602" title="pg 602"></a>
look upon Josephine, and then exclaimed
in tones, which, like a dagger pierced her heart,
"Madame! It is my wish that you retire immediately
to Malmaison."</p>

<p>Josephine staggered and would have fallen, as
if struck by a mortal blow, had she not been
caught in the arms of her son. Sobbing bitterly
with anguish, she was conveyed by Eugene to
her own apartment. Napoleon also was dreadfully
agitated. The sight of Josephine had revived
all his passionate love. But he fully believed
that Josephine had unpardonably trifled
with his affections, that she had courted the admiration
of a multitude of flatterers, and that she
had degraded herself and her husband by playing
the coquette. The proud spirit of Napoleon could
not brook such a requital for his fervid love.
With hasty strides he traversed the room, striving
to nourish his indignation. The sobs of Josephine
had deeply moved him. He yearned to
fold her again in fond love to his heart. But he
proudly resolved that he would not relent. Josephine,
with that prompt obedience which ever
characterized her, prepared immediately to comply
with his orders. It was midnight. For a
week she had lived in her carriage almost without
food or sleep. Malmaison was thirty miles
from Paris. Napoleon did not suppose that she
would leave the house until morning. Much to
his surprise, in a few moments he heard Josephine,
Eugene, and Hortense descending the stairs
to take the carriage. Napoleon, even in his anger,
could not be thus inhuman. "My heart,"
he said, "was never formed to witness tears without
emotion." He immediately descended to the
court-yard, though his pride would not yet allow
him to speak to Josephine. He, however, addressing
Eugene, urged the party to return and
obtain refreshment and repose. Josephine, all
submission, unhesitatingly yielded to his wishes,
and re-ascending the stairs, in the extremity of
exhaustion and grief, threw herself upon a couch,
in her apartment. Napoleon, equally wretched,
returned to his cabinet. Two days of utter misery
passed away, during which no intercourse
took place between the estranged parties, each
of whom loved the other with almost superhuman
intensity.</p>

<p>Love in the heart will finally triumph over all
obstructions. The struggle was long, but gradually
pride and passion yielded, and love regained
the ascendency. Napoleon so far surrendered
on the third day, as to enter the apartment of
Josephine. She was seated at a toilet-table, her
face buried in her hands, and absorbed in the
profoundest woe. The letters, which she had received
from Napoleon, and which she had evidently
been reading, were spread upon the table.
Hortense, the picture of grief and despair, was
standing in the alcove of a window. Napoleon had
opened the door softly, and his entrance had not
been heard. With an irresolute step he advanced
toward his wife, and then said, kindly and sadly,
"Josephine!" She started at the sound of that
well-known voice, and raising her swollen eyes,
swimming in tears, mournfully exclaimed, "Mon
ami"&mdash;<i>my friend</i>. This was the term of endearment
with which she had invariably addressed
her husband. It recalled a thousand delightful
reminiscences. Napoleon was vanquished. He
extended his hand. Josephine threw herself into
his arms, pillowed her aching head upon his bosom,
and in the intensity of blended joy and anguish,
wept convulsively. A long explanation
ensued. Napoleon became satisfied that Josephine
had been deeply wronged. The reconciliation
was cordial and entire, and was never again
interrupted.</p>

<p class="center">THE RECONCILIATION.</p>
</div>

<p>Napoleon now, with a stronger heart, turned
to the accomplishment of his designs to rescue
France from anarchy. He was fully conscious
of his own ability to govern the nation. He
knew that it was the almost unanimous wish of
the people that he should grasp the reins of power.
He was confident of their cordial co-operation
in any plans he might adopt. Still, it was
<a class="pagenum" id="page_603" title="pg 603"></a>
an enterprise of no small difficulty to thrust the
five Directors from their thrones, and to get the
control of the Council of Ancients and of The
Five Hundred. Never was a difficult achievement
more adroitly and proudly accomplished.</p>

<p>For many days Napoleon almost entirely secluded
himself from observation, affecting a studious
avoidance of the public gaze. He laid
aside his military dress, and assumed the peaceful
costume of the National Institute. Occasionally
he wore a beautiful Turkish sabre, suspended
by a silk ribbon. This simple dress transported
the imagination of the beholder to Aboukir,
Mount Tabor, and the Pyramids. He studiously
sought the society of literary men, and devoted
to them his attention. He invited distinguished
men of the Institute to dine with him, and avoiding
political discussion, conversed only upon literary
and scientific subjects.</p>

<p>Moreau and Bernadotte were the two rival
generals from whom Napoleon had the most to
fear. Two days after his arrival in Paris Napoleon
said to Bourrienne, "I believe that I shall
have Bernadotte and Moreau against me. But
I do not fear Moreau. He is devoid of energy.
He prefers military to political power. We shall
gain him by the promise of a command. But
Bernadotte has Moorish blood in his veins. He
is bold and enterprising. He does not like me,
and I am certain that he will oppose me. If he
should become ambitious he will venture any
thing. Besides, this fellow is not to be seduced.
He is disinterested and clever. But, after all, we
have just arrived. We shall see."</p>

<p>
apoleon formed no conspiracy. He confided
to no one his designs. And yet, in his own solitary
mind, relying entirely upon his own capacious
resources, he studied the state of affairs
and he matured his plans. Sieyes was the only
one whose talents and influence Napoleon feared.
The abb&eacute; also looked with apprehension upon
his formidable rival. They stood aloof and eyed
each other. Meeting at a dinner party, each
was too proud to make advances. Yet each
thought only of the other. Mutually exasperated,
they separated without having spoken. "Did
you see that insolent little fellow!" said Sieyes,
"he would not even condescend to notice a member
of the government, who, if they had done
right, would have caused him to be shot." "What
on earth," said Napoleon, "could have induced
them to put that priest in the Directory. He is
sold to Prussia. Unless you take care, he will
deliver you up to that power." Napoleon dined
with Moreau, who afterward in hostility to Napoleon
pointed the guns of Russia against the columns
of his countrymen. The dinner party was
at Cottier's, one of the Directors. The following
interesting conversation took place between the
rival generals. When first introduced, they looked
at each other a moment without speaking,
Napoleon, conscious of his own superiority,
and solicitous to gain the powerful co-operation
of Moreau, made the first advances, and, with
great courtesy, expressed the earnest desire he
felt to make his acquaintance. "You have returned
victorious from Egypt," replied Moreau,
"and I from Italy after a great defeat. It was
the month which General Joubert passed in
Paris, after his marriage, which caused our disasters.
This gave the allies time to reduce
Mantua, and to bring up the force which besieged
it to take a part in the action. It is always
the greater number which defeats the less."
"True," replied Napoleon, "it is always the
greater number which beats the less." "And
yet," said Gohier, "with small armies you have
frequently defeated large ones." "Even then,"
rejoined Napoleon, "it was always the inferior
force which was defeated by the superior. When
with a small body of men I was in the presence
of a large one, collecting my little band, I fell
like lightning on one of the wings of the hostile
army, and defeated it. Profiting by the disorder
which such an event never failed to occasion in
their whole line, I repeated the attack, with similar
success, in another quarter, still with my
whole force. I thus beat it in detail. The general
victory which was the result, was still an
example of the truth of the principle that the
greater force defeats the lesser." Napoleon, by
those fascinations of mind and manner, which
enabled him to win to him whom he would, soon
gained an ascendency over Moreau. And when,
two days after, in token of his regard, he sent
him a beautiful poniard set with diamonds, worth
two thousand dollars: the work was accomplished,
and Moreau was ready to do his bidding.
Napoleon gave a small and very select dinner
party. Gohier was invited. The conversation
turned on the turquoise used by the Orientals
to clasp their turbans. Napoleon, rising from
the table took from a private drawer, two very
beautiful brooches, richly set with those jewels.
One he gave to Gohier, the other to his tried
friend Desaix. "It is a little toy," said he,
"which we republicans may give and receive
without impropriety." The Director, flattered
by the delicacy of the compliment, and yet not
repelled by any thing assuming the grossness
of a bribe, yielded his heart's homage to Napoleon.</p>

<p>Republican France was surrounded by monarchies
in arms against her. Their hostility was
so inveterate, and, from the very nature of the
case, so inevitable, that Napoleon thought that
France should ever be prepared for an attack,
and that the military spirit should be carefully
fostered. Republican America, most happily,
has no foe to fear, and all her energies may be
devoted to filling the land with peace and plenty.
But a republic in monarchical Europe must sleep
by the side of its guns. "Do you, really," said
Napoleon, to Gohier, in this interview, "advocate
a general peace? You are wrong. The Republic
should never make but partial accommodations.
It should always contrive to have some war on
hand to keep alive the military spirit." We can,
perhaps, find a little extenuation for this remark,
in its apparent necessity, and in the influences
of the martial ardor in which Napoleon from his
very infancy had been enveloped. Even now,
<a class="pagenum" id="page_604" title="pg 604"></a>
it is to be feared that the time is far distant ere
the nations of the earth can learn war no more.</p>

<p>Lefebvre was commandant of the guard of the
two legislative bodies. His co-operation was important.
Napoleon sent a special invitation for
an interview. "Lefebvre," said he, "will you,
one of the pillars of the Republic, suffer it to
perish in the hands of these <i>lawyers</i>? Join me
and assist to save it." Taking from his own
aide the beautiful Turkish scimitar which he
wore, he passed the ribbon over Lefebvre's neck,
saying, "accept this sword, which I wore at the
battle of the Pyramids. I give it to you as a
token of my esteem and confidence." "Yes,"
replied Lefebvre, most highly gratified at this signal
mark of confidence and generosity, "let us
throw the lawyers into the river."</p>

<p>
apoleon soon had an interview with Bernadotte.
"He confessed," said Napoleon to Bourrienne,
"that he thought us all lost. He spoke
of external enemies, of <i>internal</i> enemies, and, at
that word he looked steadily in my face. I also
gave him a glance. But patience; the pear will
soon be ripe."</p>

<p>In this interview Napoleon inveighed against
the violence and lawlessness of the Jacobin club.
"Your own brothers," Bernadotte replied, "were
the founders of that club. And yet you reproach
me with favoring its principles. It is to the instructions
of some one, <i>I know not who</i>, that we
are to ascribe the agitation which now prevails."
"True, general," Napoleon replied, most vehemently,
"and I would rather live in the woods,
than in a society which presents no security
against violence." This conversation only
strengthened the alienation already existing between
them.</p>

<p>Bernadotte, though a brave and efficient officer,
was a jealous braggadocio. At the first interview
between these two distinguished men, when Napoleon
was in command of the army of Italy,
they contemplated each other with mutual dislike.
"I have seen a man," said Bernadotte, "of twenty-six
or seven years of age, who assumes the
air of one of fifty; and he presages any thing
but good to the Republic." Napoleon summarily
dismissed Bernadotte by saying, "he has a French
head and a Roman heart."</p>

<p>There were three political parties now dividing
France, the old royalist party, in favor of
the restoration of the Bourbons; the radical democrats,
or Jacobins, with Barras at its head, supported
by the mob of Paris; and the moderate
republicans led by Sieyes. All these parties
struggling together, and fearing each other, in
the midst of the general anarchy which prevailed,
immediately paid court to Napoleon, hoping to
secure the support of his all-powerful arm. Napoleon
determined to co-operate with the moderate
republicans. The restoration of the Bourbons
was not only out of the question, but Napoleon
had no more power to secure that result,
than had Washington to bring the United States
into peaceful submission to George III. "Had
I joined the Jacobins," said Napoleon, "I should
have risked nothing. But after conquering <i>with</i>
them, it would have been necessary almost immediately,
to conquer <i>against</i> them. A club can
not endure a permanent chief. It wants one for
every successive passion. Now to make use of
a party one day, in order to attack it the next,
under whatever pretext it is done, is still an act
of treachery. It was inconsistent with my principles."</p>

<p>Sieyes, the head of the moderate republicans,
and Napoleon soon understood each other, and
each admitted the necessity of co-operation. The
government was in a state of chaos. "Our salvation
now demands," said the wily diplomatist,
"both a head and a sword." Napoleon had both.
In one fortnight from the time when he landed
at Frejus, "the pear was ripe." The plan was
all matured for the great conflict. Napoleon, in
solitary grandeur, kept his own counsel. He had
secured the cordial co-operation, the unquestioning
obedience of all his subordinates. Like the
general upon the field of battle, he was simply to
give his orders, and columns marched, and
squadrons charged, and generals swept the field
in unquestioning obedience. Though he had
determined to ride over and to destroy the existing
government, he wished to avail himself, so
far as possible, of the mysterious power of law,
as a conqueror turns a captured battery upon the
foe from whom it had been wrested. Such a
plot, so simple, yet so bold and efficient, was
never formed before. And no one, but another
Napoleon, will be able to execute another such
again. All Paris was in a state of intense excitement.
Something great was to be done.
Napoleon was to do it. But nobody knew when,
or what, or how. All impatiently awaited orders.
The majority of the Senate, or Council of Ancients,
conservative in its tendencies, and having
once seen, during the reign of terror, the horrors
of Jacobin domination, were ready, most obsequiously,
to rally beneath the banner of so resolute
a leader as Napoleon. They were prepared,
without question, to pass any vote which he
should propose. The House of Representatives
or Council of Five Hundred, more democratic in
its constitution, contained a large number of vulgar,
ignorant, and passionate demagogues, struggling
to grasp the reins of power. Carnot,
whose co-operation Napoleon had entirely secured,
was President of the Senate. Lucien Bonaparte,
the brother of Napoleon, was Speaker of the
House. The two bodies met in the palace of
the Tuileries. The constitution conferred upon
the Council of Ancients, the right to decide upon
the place of meeting for both legislative assemblies.</p>

<p>All the officers of the garrison in Paris, and all
the distinguished military men in the metropolis,
had solicited the honor of a presentation to Napoleon.
Without any public announcement, each
one was privately informed that Napoleon would
see him on the morning of the 9th of November.
All the regiments in the city had also solicited
the honor of a review by the distinguished conqueror.
They were also informed that Napoleon
would review them early on the morning of the
<a class="pagenum" id="page_605" title="pg 605"></a>
9th of November. The Council of Ancients was
called to convene at six o'clock on the morning
of the same day. The Council of Five Hundred
were also to convene at 11 o'clock of the same
morning. This, the famous 18th of Brumaire,
was the destined day for the commencement of
the great struggle. These appointments were
given in such a way as to attract no public attention.
The general-in-chief was thus silently arranging
his forces for the important conflict.
To none did he reveal those combinations, by
which he anticipated a bloodless victory.</p>

<p class="center">THE MORNING LEVEE.</p>
</div>

<p>The morning of the 9th of November arrived.
The sun rose with unwonted splendor over the
domes of the thronged city. A more brilliant
day never dawned. Through all the streets of
the mammoth metropolis there was heard, in the
earliest twilight of the day, the music of martial
bands, the tramp of battalions, the clatter of iron
hoofs, and the rumbling of heavy artillery wheels
over the pavements, as regiments of infantry,
artillery, and cavalry, in the proudest array,
marched to the Boulevards to receive the honor
of a review from the conqueror of Italy and of
Egypt. The whole city was in commotion,
guided by the unseen energies of Napoleon in
the retirement of his closet. At eight o'clock Napoleon's
house, in the Rue Chanteraine, was so
thronged with illustrious military men, in most
brilliant uniform, that every room was filled and
even the street was crowded with the resplendent
guests. At that moment the Council of Ancients
<a class="pagenum" id="page_606" title="pg 606"></a>
passed the decree, which Napoleon had prepared,
that the two legislative bodies should transfer
their meetings to St. Cloud, a few miles from
Paris; and that Napoleon Bonaparte should be
put in command of all the military forces in the
city, to secure the public peace. The removal
to St. Cloud was a merciful precaution against
bloodshed. It secured the legislatures from the
ferocious interference of a Parisian mob. The
President of the Council was himself commissioned
to bear the decree to Napoleon. He elbowed
his way through the brilliant throng,
crowding the door and the apartment of Napoleon's
dwelling, and presented to him the ordinance.
Napoleon was ready to receive it. He
stepped upon the balcony, gathered his vast retinue
of powerful guests before him, and in a
loud and firm voice, read to them the decree.
"Gentlemen," said he, "will you help me save
the Republic?" One simultaneous burst of enthusiasm
rose from every lip, as drawing their
swords from their scabbards they waved them in
the air and shouted, "We swear it, we swear
it." The victory was virtually won. Napoleon
was now at the head of the French nation. Nothing
remained but to finish his conquest. There
was no retreat left open for his foes. There was
hardly the possibility of a rally. And now Napoleon
summoned all his energies to make his
triumph most illustrious. Messengers were immediately
sent to read the decree to the troops
already assembled, in the utmost display of martial
pomp, to greet the idol of the army, and who
were in a state of mind to welcome him most exultingly
as their chief. A burst of enthusiastic
acclamation ascended from their ranks which
almost rent the skies. Napoleon immediately
mounted his horse, and, surrounded by the most
magnificent staff, whom he had thus ingeniously
assembled at his house, and, accompanied by a
body of fifteen hundred cavalry, whom he had
taken the precaution to rendezvous near his
dwelling, proceeded to the palace of the Tuileries.
The gorgeous spectacle burst like a vision
upon astonished Paris. It was Napoleon's first
public appearance. Dressed in the utmost simplicity
of a civilian's costume, he rode upon his
magnificent charger, the centre of all eyes. The
gleaming banners, waving in the breeze, and the
gorgeous trappings of silver and gold, with which
his retinue was embellished, set off in stronger
relief the majestic simplicity of his own appearance.
With the pomp and the authority of an
enthroned king, Napoleon entered the Council of
the Ancients. The Ancients themselves were
dazzled by his sudden apparition in such imposing
and unexpected splendor and power. Ascending
the bar, attended by an imposing escort,
he addressed the assembly and took his oath of
office. "You," said Napoleon, "are the wisdom
of the nation. To you it belongs to concert
measures for the salvation of the Republic. I
come, surrounded by our generals, to offer you
support. Faithfully will I fulfill the task you
have intrusted to me. Let us not look into the
past for precedents. Nothing in history resembles
the eighteenth century. Nothing in the
eighteenth century resembles the present moment."</p>

<p>An aid was immediately sent to the palace of
the Luxembourg, to inform the five Directors,
there in session, of the decree. Two of the Directors,
Sieyes and Ducos, were pledged to Napoleon,
and immediately resigned their offices,
and hastened to the Tuileries. Barras, bewildered
and indignant, sent his secretary with a
remonstrance. Napoleon, already assuming the
authority of an emperor, and speaking as if France
were his patrimony, came down upon him with
a torrent of invective. "Where," he indignantly
exclaimed, "is that beautiful France which I left
you so brilliant? I left you peace. I find war.
I left you victories. I find but defeats. I left
you the millions of Italy. I find taxation and
beggary. Where are the hundred thousand men,
my companions in glory? They are dead. This
state of things can not continue. It will lead to
despotism." Barras was terrified. He feared
to have Napoleon's eagle eye investigate his peculations.
He resigned. Two Directors only now
were left, Gohier and Moulins. It took a majority
of the five to constitute a quorum. The
two were powerless. In despair of successful
resistance and fearing vengeance they hastened
to the Tuileries to find Napoleon. They were
introduced to him surrounded by Sieyes, Ducos,
and a brilliant staff. Napoleon received them
cordially. "I am glad to see you," said he. "I
doubt not that you will both resign. Your patriotism
will not allow you to oppose a revolution
which is both inevitable and necessary." "I do
not yet despair," said Gohier, vehemently, "aided
by my colleague, Moulins, of saving the Republic."
"With what will you save it?" exclaimed Napoleon.
"With the Constitution which is crumbling
to pieces?" Just at that moment a messenger
came in and informed the Directors that
Santerre, the brewer, who, during the Reign of
Terror, had obtained a bloody celebrity as leader
of the Jacobins, was rousing the mob in the faubourgs
to resistance. "General Moulins," said
Napoleon, firmly, "you are the friend of Santerre.
Tell him that at the very first movement
he makes, I will cause him to be shot." Moulins,
exasperated yet appalled, made an apologetic
reply. "The Republic is in danger," said Napoleon.
"We must save it. <i>It is my will.</i> Sieyes,
Ducos, and Barras have resigned. You are two
individuals insulated and powerless. I advise
you not to resist." They still refused. Napoleon
had no time to spend in parleying. He immediately
sent them both back into the Luxembourg,
separated them and placed them under
arrest. Fouch&eacute;,<sup><a href="#fn3" id="r3">[3]</a></sup> occupying the important post
<a class="pagenum" id="page_607" title="pg 607"></a>
of Minister of Police, though not in Napoleon's
confidence, yet anxious to display his homage to
the rising luminary, called upon Napoleon and
informed him that he had closed the barriers,
and had thus prevented all ingress or egress.
"What means this folly?" said Napoleon. "Let
those orders be instantly countermanded. Do
we not march with the opinion of the nation, and
by its strength alone? Let no citizen be interrupted.
Let every publicity be given to what is
done."</p>

<p>The Council of Five Hundred, in great confusion
and bewilderment, assembled at eleven
o'clock. Lucien immediately communicated the
decree transferring their session to St. Cloud.
This cut off all debate. The decree was perfectly
legal. There could therefore be no legal
pretext for opposition. Napoleon, the idol of the
army, had the whole military power obedient to
his nod. Therefore resistance of any kind was
worse than folly. The deed was adroitly done.
At eleven o'clock the day's work was accomplished.
There was no longer a Directory. Napoleon
was the appointed chief of the troops, and
they were filling the streets with enthusiastic
shouts of "Live Napoleon." The Council of
Ancients were entirely at his disposal. And a
large party in the Council of Five Hundred were
also wholly subservient to his will. Napoleon,
proud, silent, reserved, fully conscious of his own
intellectual supremacy, and regarding the generals,
the statesmen, and the multitude around
him, as a man contemplates children, ascended
the grand staircase of the Tuileries as if it were
his hereditary home. Nearly all parties united
to sustain his triumph. Napoleon was a soldier.
The guns of Paris joyfully thundered forth the
victory of one who seemed the peculiar favorite
of the God of war. Napoleon was a scholar,
stimulating intellect to its mightiest achievements.
The scholars of Paris, gratefully united
to weave a chaplet for the brow of their honored
associate and patron. Napoleon was, for those
days of profligacy and unbridled lust, a model of
purity of morals, and of irreproachable integrity.
The proffered bribe of millions could not tempt
him. The dancing daughters of Herodias, with
all their blandishments, could not lure him from
his life of Herculean toil and from? his majestic
patriotism. The wine which glitters in the cup,
never vanquished him. At the shrine of no vice
was he found a worshiper. The purest and the
best in France, disgusted with that gilded corruption
which had converted the palaces of the
Bourbons into harems of voluptuous sin, and still
more deeply loathing that vulgar and revolting
vice, which had transformed Paris into a house
of infamy, enlisted all their sympathies in behalf
of the exemplary husband and the incorruptible
patriot. Napoleon was one of the most firm and
unflinching friends of law and order. France
was weary of anarchy and was trembling under
the apprehension that the gutters of the
guillotine were again to be clotted with blood.
And mothers and maidens prayed for God's
blessing upon Napoleon, who appeared to them
as a messenger sent from Heaven for their protection.</p>

<p>During the afternoon and the night his room
at the Tuileries was thronged with the most illustrious
statesmen, generals, and scholars of
Paris, hastening to pledge to him their support.
Napoleon, perfectly unembarrassed and never at
a loss in any emergency, gave his orders for the
ensuing day. Lannes was intrusted with a body
of troops to guard the Tuileries. Murat, who,
said Napoleon, "was superb at Aboukir," with
a numerous cavalry and a corps of grenadiers
was stationed at St. Cloud, a thunderbolt in Napoleon's
right hand. Woe betide the mob into
whose ranks that thunderbolt may be hurled.
Moreau, with five hundred men, was stationed
to guard the Luxembourg, where the two refractory
Directors were held under arrest. Serrurier
was posted in a commanding position with a
strong reserve, prompt for any unexpected exigence.
Even a body of troops were sent to accompany
Barras to his country seat, ostensibly
as an escort of honor, but in reality to guard
against any change in that venal and versatile
mind. The most energetic measures were immediately
adopted to prevent any rallying point
for the disaffected. Bills were every where posted,
exhorting the citizens to be quiet, and assuring
them that powerful efforts were making to save
the Republic. These minute precautions were
characteristic of Napoleon. He believed in destiny.
Yet he left nothing for destiny to accomplish.
He ever sought to make provision for all
conceivable contingencies. These measures were
completely successful. Though Paris was in a
delirium of excitement, there were no outbreaks
of lawless violence. Neither Monarchist, Republican,
nor Jacobin knew what Napoleon intended
to do. All were conscious that he would
do something. It was known that the Jacobin
party in the Council of Five Hundred on the ensuing
day, would make a desperate effort at resistance.
Sieyes, perfectly acquainted with revolutionary
movements, urged Napoleon to arrest
some forty of the Jacobins most prominent in the
Council. This would have secured an easy victory
on the morrow. Napoleon, however, rejected
the advice, saying, "I pledged my word this
morning to protect the national representation.
I will not this evening violate my oath." Had
the Assembly been convened in Paris, all the
mob of the faubourgs would have risen, like an
inundation, in their behalf, and torrents of blood
must have been shed. The sagacious transference
of the meeting to St. Cloud, several miles
from Paris, saved those lives. The powerful
military display, checked any attempt at a march
upon St. Cloud. What could the mob do, with
Murat, Lannes, and Serrurier, guided by the energies
of Napoleon, ready to hurl their solid columns
upon them?</p>

</div>

<p>The delicacy of attention with which Napoleon
treated Josephine, was one of the most remarkable
traits in his character. It is not strange
that he should have won from her a love almost
more than human. During the exciting scenes
<a class="pagenum" id="page_608" title="pg 608"></a>
of this day, when no one could tell whether events
were guiding him to a crown or to the guillotine,
Napoleon did not forget his wife, who was awaiting
the result, with deep solicitude, in her chamber
in the Rue Chanteraine. Nearly every hour
he dispatched a messenger to Josephine, with a
hastily written line communicating to her the
progress of events. Late at night he returned
to his home, apparently as fresh and unexhausted
as in the morning. He informed Josephine
minutely of the scenes of the day, and then threw
himself upon a sofa, for an hour's repose. Early
the next morning he was on horseback, accompanied
by a regal retinue, directing his steps to
St. Cloud. Three halls had been prepared in
the palace; one for the Ancients, one for the
Five Hundred, and one for Napoleon. He thus
assumed the position which he knew it to be the
almost unanimous will of the nation that, he
should fill. During the night the Jacobins had
arranged a very formidable resistance. Napoleon
was considered to be in imminent peril. He
would be denounced as a traitor. Sieyes and
Ducos had each a post-chaise and six horses,
waiting at the gate of St. Cloud, prepared, in
case of reverse, to escape for life. There were
many ambitious generals, ready to mount the
crest of any refluent wave to sweep Napoleon to
destruction. Bernadotte was the most to be
feared. Orders were given to cut down the first
person who should attempt to harangue the
troops. Napoleon, riding at the head of this imposing
military display, manifested no agitation.
He knew, however, perfectly well the capriciousness
of the popular voice, and that the multitude
in the same hour could cry "Hosanna!" and "Crucify!"
The two Councils met. The tumult in the
Five Hundred was fearful. Cries of "Down with
the dictator!" "Death to the tyrant!" "Live the
Constitution!" filled the hall, and drowned the
voice of deliberation. The friends of Napoleon
were swept before the flood of passion. It was
proposed that every member should immediately
take anew the oath to support the Constitution.
No one dared to peril his life by the refusal.
Even Lucien, the Speaker, was compelled to descend
from his chair and take the oath. The
Ancients, overawed by the unexpected violence
of this opposition in the lower and more popular
house, began to be alarmed and to recede. The
opposition took a bold and aggressive stand, and
proposed a decree of outlawry against Napoleon.
The friends of Napoleon, remembering past
scenes of carnage, were timid and yielding. Defeat
seemed inevitable. Victory was apparently
turned into discomfiture and death. In this
emergency Napoleon displayed the same coolness,
energy, and tact with which so often, on
the field of battle, in the most disastrous hour,
he had rolled back the tide of defeat in the resplendent
waves of victory. His own mind was
the corps de reserve which he now marched into
the conflict to arrest the rout of his friends.
Taking with him a few aids and a band of grenadiers,
he advanced to the door of the hall. On
his way he met Bernadotte. "You are marching
to the guillotine," said his rival, sternly.
"We shall see," Napoleon coolly replied. Leaving
the soldiers, with their glittering steel and
nodding plumes, at the entrance of the room, he
ascended the tribune. The hush of perfect silence
pervaded the agitated hall. "Gentlemen,"
said he, "you are on a volcano. You deemed
the Republic in danger. You called me to your
aid. I obeyed. And now I am assailed by a
thousand calumnies. They talk of C&aelig;sar, of
Cromwell, of military despotism, as if any thing
in antiquity resembled the present moment
<a class="pagenum" id="page_609" title="pg 609"></a>
Danger presses. Disaster thickens. We have
no longer a government. The Directors have
resigned. The Five Hundred are in a tumult.
Emissaries are instigating Paris to revolt. Agitators
would gladly bring back the revolutionary
tribunals. But fear not. Aided by my companions
in arms I will protect you. I desire nothing
for myself, but to save the Republic. And I
solemnly swear to protect that <i>liberty and equality,</i>
for which we have made such sacrifices."
"And the <i>Constitution</i>!" some one cried out.
Napoleon had purposely omitted the <i>Constitution</i>
in his oath, for he despised it, and was at that
moment laboring for its overthrow. He paused
for a moment, and then, with increasing energy
exclaimed, "The Constitution! You have none.
You violated it when the Executive infringed the
rights of the Legislature. You violated it when
the Legislature struck at the independence of the
Executive. You violated it when, with sacriligious
hand, both the Legislature and the Executive
struck at the sovereignty of the people,
by annulling their elections. The Constitution!
It is a mockery; invoked by all, regarded by none."</p>

</div>

<p>Rallied by the presence of Napoleon, and by
these daring words, his friends recovered their
courage, and two-thirds of the Assembly rose in
expression of their confidence and support. At
this moment intelligence arrived that the Five
Hundred were compelling Lucien to put to the
vote Napoleon's outlawry. Not an instant was
to be lost. There is a mysterious power in law.
The passage of that vote would probably have
been fatal. Life and death were trembling in the
balance. "I would then have given two hundred
millions," said Napoleon, "to have had Ney
<a class="pagenum" id="page_610" title="pg 610"></a>
by my side." Turning to the Ancients, he exclaimed,
"if any orator, paid by foreigners, shall
talk of outlawing me, I will appeal for protection
to my brave companions in arms, whose plumes
are nodding at the door. Remember that I march
accompanied by the God of fortune and by the
God of war."</p>

<p>He immediately left the Ancients, and, attended
by his military band, hastened to the Council
of Five Hundred. On his way he met Augereau,
who was pale and trembling, deeming Napoleon
lost. "You have got yourself into a pretty fix,"
said he, with deep agitation. "Matters were worse
at Arcola," Napoleon coolly replied. "Keep
quiet. All will be changed in half an hour."
Followed by his grenadiers, he immediately entered
the Hall of the Five Hundred. The soldiers
remained near the door. Napoleon traversed
alone half of the room to reach the bar. It was
an hour in which nothing could save him but the
resources of his own mind. Furious shouts rose
from all parts of the house. "What means this!
down with the tyrant! begone! begone!" "The
winds," says Napoleon, "suddenly escaping from
the caverns of &AElig;olus can give but a faint idea
of that tempest." In the midst of the horrible
confusion he in vain endeavored to speak. The
members, in the wildest fray, crowded around
him. The grenadiers witnessing the peril of
their chief rushed to his rescue. A dagger was
struck at his bosom. A soldier, with his arm,
parried the blow. With their bayonets they
drove back the members, and encircling Napoleon,
bore him from the Hall. Napoleon had
hardly descended the outer steps ere some one
informed him that his brother Lucien was surrounded
by the infuriated deputies, and that his
life was in imminent jeopardy. "Colonel Dumoulin,"
said he, "take a battalion of grenadiers
and hasten to my brother's deliverance." The
soldiers rushed into the room, drove back the
crowd who, with violent menaces, were surrounding
Lucien, and saying, "It is by your brother's
commands," escorted him in safety out of the
hall into the court-yard. Napoleon, now mounting
his horse, with Lucien by his side, rode along
in front of his troops. "The Council of Five
Hundred," exclaimed Lucien, "is dissolved. It
is I that tell you so. Assassins have taken possession
of the hall of meeting. I summon you
to march and clear it of them." "Soldiers!"
said Napoleon, "can I rely upon you?" "Long
live Bonaparte," was the simultaneous response.
Murat took a battalion of grenadiers and marched
to the entrance of the hall. When Murat
headed a column it was well known that there
would be no child's play. "Charge bayonets,
forward!" he exclaimed, with imperturbable coolness.
The drums beat the charge. Steadily the
bristling line of steel advanced. The terrified
representatives leaped over the benches, rushed
through the passage ways, and sprang out of
the windows, throwing upon the floor, in their
precipitate flight, gowns, scarfs, and hats. In
two minutes the hall was cleared. As the Representatives
were flying in dismay across the
garden, an officer proposed that the soldiers
should be ordered to fire upon them. Napoleon
decisively refused, saying, "It is my wish that
not a single drop of blood be spilt."</p>

<p>As Napoleon wished to avail himself as far as
possible, of the forms of law, he assembled the
two legislative bodies in the evening. Those
only attended who were friendly to his cause.
Unanimously they decreed that Napoleon had
deserved well of his country; they abolished the
Directory. The executive power they vested in
Napoleon, Sieyes, and Ducos, with the title of
Consuls. Two committees of twenty-five members
each, taken from the two Councils, were
appointed to co-operate with the Consuls in
forming a new Constitution. During the evening
the rumor reached Paris that Napoleon had
failed in his enterprise. The consternation was
great. The mass of the people, of all ranks,
dreading the renewal of revolutionary horrors,
and worn out with past convulsions, passionately
longed for repose. Their only hope was in Napoleon.
At nine o'clock at night intelligence
of the change of government was officially announced,
by a proclamation which the victor had
dictated with the rapidity and the glowing eloquence
which characterized all of his mental acts.
It was read by torchlight to assembled and deeply
agitated groups, all over the city. The welcome
tidings were greeted with the liveliest demonstrations
of applause. At three o'clock in
the morning Napoleon threw himself into his
carriage to return to Paris. Bourrienne accompanied
him. Napoleon appeared so absorbed in
thought, that he uttered not one single word
during the ride.</p>

<p>At four o'clock in the morning he alighted
from his carriage, at the door of his dwelling in
the Rue Chanteraine. Josephine, in the greatest
anxiety, was watching at the window for his
approach. Napoleon had not been able to send
her one single line during the turmoil and the
peril of that eventful day. She sprang to meet
him. Napoleon fondly encircled her in his arms,
briefly recapitulated the scenes of the day, and
assured her that since he had taken the oath of
office, he had not allowed himself to speak to a
single individual, for he wished that the beloved
voice of his Josephine might be the first to congratulate
him upon his virtual accession to the
Empire of France. The heart of Josephine could
appreciate a delicacy of love so refined and so
touching. Well might she say, "Napoleon is
the most fascinating of men." It was then after
four o'clock in the morning. The dawn of the
day was to conduct Napoleon to a new scene
of Herculean toil in organizing the Republic.
Throwing himself upon a couch, for a few moments
of repose, he exclaimed, gayly, "good-night,
my Josephine! To-morrow, we sleep in
the palace of the Luxembourg."</p>

<p>
apoleon was then but twenty-nine years of
age. And yet, under circumstances of inconceivable
difficulty, with unhesitating reliance
upon his own mental resources, he assumed the
enormous care of creating and administering a
<a class="pagenum" id="page_611" title="pg 611"></a>
new government for thirty millions of people.
Never did he achieve a victory which displayed
more consummate genius. On no occasion of
his life did his majestic intellectual power beam
forth with more brilliance. It is not to be expected
that, for ages to come, the world will be
united in opinion respecting this transaction.
Some represent it as an outrage against law
and liberty. Others consider it a necessary act
which put an end to corruption and anarchy.
That the course which Napoleon pursued was in
accordance with the wishes of the overwhelming
majority of the French people no one can doubt.
It is questionable whether, even now, France is
prepared for self-government. There can be no
question that then the republic had totally failed.
Said Napoleon, in reference to this revolution,
"For my part, all my share of the plot, was
confined to assembling the crowd of my visitors
at the same hour in the morning, and marching
at their head to seize upon power. It was from
the threshold of my door, and without my friends
having any previous knowledge of my intentions,
that I led them to this conquest. It was amidst
the brilliant escort which they formed, their lively
joy and unanimous ardor, that I presented
myself at the bar of the Ancients to thank them
for the dictatorship with which they invested me.
Metaphysicians have disputed and will long dispute,
whether we did not violate the laws, and
whether we were not criminal. But these are
mere abstractions which should disappear before
imperious necessity. One might as well blame
a sailor for waste and destruction, when he cuts
away a mast to save his ship. The fact is, had
it not been for us the country must have been
lost. We saved it. The authors of that memorable
state transaction ought to answer their
accusers proudly, like the Roman, 'We protest
that we have saved our country. Come with us
and render thanks to the Gods.'"</p>

<p>With the exception of the Jacobins all parties
were strongly in favor of this revolution. For
ten years the people had been so accustomed to
the violation of the laws, that they had ceased
to condemn such acts, and judged of them only
by their consequences. All over France the feeling
was nearly universal in favor of the new
government. Says Alison, who surely will not
be accused of regarding Napoleon with a partial
eye, "Napoleon rivaled C&aelig;sar in the clemency
with which he used his victory. No proscriptions
or massacres, few arrests or imprisonments
followed the triumph of order over revolution.
On the contrary, numerous acts of mercy, as
wise as they were magnanimous, illustrated the
rise of the consular throne. The elevation of
Napoleon was not only unstained by blood, but
not even a single captive long lamented the ear
of the victor. A signal triumph of the principles
of humanity over those of cruelty, glorious alike
to the actors and the age in which it occurred;
and a memorable proof how much more durable
are the victories obtained by moderation and
wisdom, than those achieved by violence and
stained by blood."</p>

<h2 id="PARADISE_LOST">PARADISE LOST.</h2>

<p class="drop">My knapsack was on my shoulder.&mdash;So
said Armand, a young artist, when a
little company of us were sitting together the
other evening.&mdash;</p>

<p>My knapsack was on my shoulder, my ashen
stick in hand; three leagues of dusty road had
whitened me like a miller. Whence I came,
whither I was going&mdash;what matters it? I was
not twenty years of age. My starting point,
therefore, was home; my goal was Paradise&mdash;any
earthly Paradise I could find. The country
was not particularly picturesque; and the weather
was very hot. Great undulations of harvest-laden
fields rolled irregularly on all sides. Here
was a hamlet; there a solitary farm-house; yonder
a wood; on each eminence a windmill.
Some peasants that were in the fields sang; and
the birds chirped at them as if in mockery. One
or two wagons, dragged by oxen and horses,
slowly moved along the tree-bordered road. I
sat down on a heap of stones. A wagoner gruffly
asked me if I was tired, and offered me "a
lift." I accepted; and soon I was stretched
where dung had been; jolted into an uneasy
half-slumber, not without its charm, with the
bells of the lazy team softly jingling in my ears,
until I thought fifty silver voices were calling
me away to a home that must be bright, and a
land that must he beautiful.</p>

<p>I awoke in a mood sufficiently benign to receive
an apology. The man had forgotten me
when he turned off the high road, and had taken
me half a league into the country. Where was
the harm, honest wagoner? I am not going any
where; "I am only going to Paradise." There
was no village of that name in the neighborhood,
he said; but he had no doubt I would be pleased
to see the grounds of the chateau. Of course, I
had come on purpose for that. I handed him his
<i>pour-boire</i>. "Drink my health, good man, and
injure your own. Let us see these grounds.'"
The man showed me through a meadow near
the farm (to which he belonged) and left me,
tossing the silver piece I had given him in his
hard hand. I soon observed that the place was
worth seeing.</p>

<p>A hasty glance showed it to be a fragment of
wild nature, occupied in its original state, and
barricaded against civilization. There were
woods, and solitary trees, and lakes, and streams
of sufficient dimensions for grandeur; and, when
once the wall disappeared amidst the heavy foliage,
I could at first discern no traces whatever
of the presence of man. However, on closer examination,
I discovered that nature had been improved
upon; that all objects which might ungraciously
intercept the view, or deform a landscape,
had been removed. There were no sham
ruins nor artificial cascades; but the stranger's
steps were led, by some ingenious process of
plantation, insensibly to the best points of view.
I felt, and was thankful, for the presence of the
art which so industriously endeavored to conceal
itself; but being, at that time, as most young
<a class="pagenum" id="page_612" title="pg 612"></a>
men are, inclined to compare great things with
small&mdash;thinking to be epigrammatic and knowing&mdash;I
exclaimed aloud: "The toilet of this park
has been admirably performed."</p>

<p>"A vulgar idea, vulgarly expressed," said a
clear, firm voice above me. I looked up, thinking
that somebody was hidden in a tree; and, to
my surprise, saw a young woman, upon a fine
large horse, holding a riding-whip playfully over
my head. She had approached across the turf
unheard; and had heard my exclamation, which,
I assure you, was meant for no ears but my own.</p>

<p>"Madam," replied I, when I had recovered
from my confusion, "I think you misunderstand
me. There is no vulgarity in comparing a prospect
in which every superfluity is thus tastefully
pruned away, to a woman who, instead of loading
herself with ornaments, uses the arts of the
toilet to display all her beauties to the best advantage."</p>

<p>"The explanation will not do," she replied.
"It wants frankness. Your phrase simply meant
that you were ashamed of the admiration this
view had at first excited; and that you thought
it necessary to exert the manly privilege of contempt.
If I had not seen you yonder using your
sketch-book, I should take you for a traveling
hair-dresser."</p>

<p>The tone and manner of my new acquaintance
puzzled me exceedingly; and I was at first rather
irritated by the hostile attitude she assumed
on such slight grounds. It was evident she
wished to provoke an intellectual contest; for,
at the moment, I did not understand that her
real desire was to suppress the formalities of an
introduction. I returned to the charge; she replied.
A broadside of repartee was fired off on
either side; but insensibly we met upon common
ground; affectation was discarded; and, as we
streamed irregularly along the swardy avenues,
or stopped at the entrance of a long vista&mdash;she
gently walking her docile genet; I with my hand
upon its mane&mdash;we made more advances toward
familiarity and friendship in an hour than would
have been possible under any other circumstances
in a season.</p>

<p>Let me describe my impressions as I received
them. Otherwise, how will the narrative illustrate
the theory? I am endeavoring to show, by
example, what an immense structure of happiness
may be built upon a very flimsy ground;
that the material sequence of this life's events
need have no correspondence with the sequence
of our sentiments; that&mdash;But I must not anticipate.</p>

<p>The lady, dressed in a green riding-habit, was
remarkably handsome, as this miniature will
show.</p>

<p>And Armand drew a small case from his
breast.</p>

<p>"It is made from memory; but I will answer
for its exactitude."</p>

<p>"We all know the face well enough, my
friend," quoth Prevost; "it re-appears in nearly
all your pictures, like Raphael's Fornarina. Last
year you made it do duty for Medea; this year,
modified to suit the occasion, it will appear
in the Salon as Charlotte Corday. Why have
you so carefully avoided that type in your Juliet
and your Heloise? One would imagine that, instead
of being associated with pleasant recollections,
it suggested nothing but strife, violence,
and despair."</p>

<p>"Were that the case, you know," quoth Armand,
with feigned sprightliness, "my theory
falls to the ground; and, in telling you my story,
I am only impertinently taking advantage of your
good-nature to make a confession, and thus ease
a somewhat troubled mind. Listen to the end;
it is not far off."</p>

<p>We reached a grotto on the borders of a little
lake, where, to my surprise, an elegant breakfast
was laid out. There were two seats placed
ready; and Fifine, the maid, was there to serve.
We partook of the meal together, talking of
every thing except of ourselves; but thinking
of nothing else. Once or twice a reflection on
the oddity of this reception flitted across my
mind; but I thought that I had fallen in with
some eccentric mistress of the castle&mdash;such as
one reads of in middle-age romances&mdash;who was
proud to give hospitality to a wandering artist.
The lady called me Hector, and I called her Andromache;
and, under the influence of some
generous wine that came in with the dessert, I
went so far as to declare that my love for her
was unbounded, and that she must be my bride.
I was thrown into ecstasies of delight by the
frank reply, that it only depended upon me to fix
the day! What follies I committed I scarcely
recollect; but I know that Fifine scolded me;
and said that, for a well-educated young man, I
was dreadfully forward.</p>

<p>What a delightful half-hour was that which
succeeded! The entrance of the grotto was
wreathed with vines. The ripples of the lake
broke upon a little beach of sand that seemed of
gold dust; the path by which we had come along
ran at the foot of a precipice for about thirty
yards, and then climbed a steep bank; the expanse
of water&mdash;possibly it was merely a large
pool, but these things magnify in memory&mdash;nestled
at the feet of some lofty wooded slopes, which,
with the pure blue sky, it reflected. We sat,
side by side, hand in hand; but Fifine, whose
notions of propriety were extremely rigid, expostulated
vehemently. I whispered that she ought
to be sent away; and Andromache was, perhaps,
of my opinion; but she did not venture to agree
with me aloud. Thus the hour passed in silent
happiness; for our hearts soon became too full
for words; and I solemnly declare, that, to spend
such another day, I would discount ten years of
my existence.</p>

<p>As evening drew near, and I began to dream
of the delights of a twilight stroll along the margin
of the lake, Fifine pitilessly suggested an adjournment
to the chateau. The word grated
harshly on my ear. I had almost pictured to
myself the lady as a dryad, or a nymph living ever
amidst trees and grottoes. But prosy Fifine carried
her point; and, in half an hour, we were in
<a class="pagenum" id="page_613" title="pg 613"></a>
the saloon of a most comfortable modern dwelling,
furnished with Parisian elegance. Several
very commonplace looking servants stared at me
as I entered. My romantic ideas at once received
a shock. Five minutes afterward a post-chaise
rolled up to the door, and a stout old gentleman,
accompanied by a tall, handsome young man, issued
therefrom.</p>

<p>Why should I give you the ludicrous details
of the explanation? Andromache was betrothed
to Monsieur Hector Chose; but she had never
seen him. Her father, a wealthy naturalist, had
gone that day to meet the bridegroom at a neighboring
town. The young lady (who was of a
romantic disposition) had descried me in the
park, and had fancied this was a pre-arranged
surprise. She had got up the breakfast in the
grotto; and had made my acquaintance as I have
related. I answered to the name of Hector; she
naturally retorted Andromache. This was the
whole explanation of the mistake. I was overwhelmed
with shame, when the father and the
real Hector, with vociferous laughter, undeceived
me; and the young lady herself went away in
tears of vexation. For a moment, I hoped that
I had produced an ineffaceable impression; but
I was soon undeceived. In my mortification I
insulted Hector. A hostile meeting was the result.
I received a severe wound, and lay a long
time helpless in a neighboring hamlet. Still my
love was not cured. Even when I heard that
the marriage had been celebrated, I persisted in
looking upon the bride as my Andromache; but
when Madame Duclique, her cousin, came to see
me, she destroyed all my illusions. Andromache,
she said, though with much affectation of romance,
was a very matter-of-fact personage, and
remembered our love-passage only as a ridiculous
mistake. She had married Hector, not only
without repugnance but with delight. He brought
her every thing she desired&mdash;a handsome person,
a fine fortune, an exalted position; and she was
the first to joke on the subject of "that poor
counterfeit Hector."</p>

<p>This interview cured me at once. I discovered
that I was strong enough to leave the Paradise
I had lost. Madame Duclique, an amiable and
beautiful person, gave me a seat in her carriage,
and drove me to the town of Arques. I feel
grateful to my Andromache for having impressed
upon my mind an enduring form of beauty.</p>

<p>"Let us drink her health!"</p>

<h2 id="THE_VATTEVILLE_RUBY">THE VATTEVILLE RUBY.</h2>

<p class="drop">The clock of the church of Besan&ccedil;on had
struck nine, when a woman about fifty years
of age, wrapped in a cotton shawl and carrying
a small basket on her arm, knocked at the door
of a house in the Rue St. Vincent, which, however,
at the period we refer to, bore the name
of Rue de la Libert&eacute;. The door opened. "It is
you, Dame Margaret," said the porter, with a very
cross look. "It is high time for you. All my
lodgers have come home long since; you are always
the last, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That is not my fault, I assure you, my dear
M. Thiebaut," said the old woman in a deprecatory
tone. "My day's work is only just finished,
and when work is to be done&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's all very fine," he muttered. "It
might do well enough if I could even reckon on
a Christmas-box at the end of the year; but as
it is, I may count myself well off, if I do but get
paid for taking up their letters."</p>

<p>The old woman did not hear the last words,
for with quick and firm step she had been making
her way up the six flights of stairs, steep enough
to make her head reel had she been ascending
them for the first time. "Nine o'clock!&mdash;nine
o'clock! How uneasy she must be!" and as she
spoke, she opened with her latch-key the door
of a wretched garret, in which dimly burned a
rushlight, whose flickering flame scarcely seemed
to render visible the scanty furniture the room
contained.</p>

<p>"Is that you, my good Margaret," said a feeble
and broken voice from the farther end of the little
apartment.</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear lady; yes, it is I; and very
sorry I am to have made you uneasy. But
Madame Lebriton, my worthy employer, is so
active herself, that she always finds the work-woman's
day too short&mdash;though it is good twelve
hours&mdash;and just as I was going to fold up my
work, she brought me a job in a great hurry. I
could not refuse her; but this time, I must own,
I got well paid for being obliging, for after I had
done, she said in her most good-natured way:
'Here, you shall take home with you some of
this nice pie, and this bottle of good wine, and
have a comfortable supper with your sister.' So
she always calls you, madame," added Margaret,
while complacently glancing at the basket, the
contents of which she now laid out upon the
table. "As I believe it is safest for you, I do
not undeceive her, though it is easily known she
can not have looked very close at us, or she might
have seen that I could only be the servant of so
noble-looking a lady&mdash;"</p>

<p>The feeble voice interrupted her: "My servant&mdash;you
my servant! when, instead of rewarding
your services, I allow you to toil for my support,
and to lavish upon me the most tender, the
moat devoted affection! My poor Margaret! you
who have undertaken for me at your age, and
with your infirmities, daily and arduous toil, are
you not indeed a sister of whom I may well be
proud? Your nobility has a higher origin than
mine. Reduced by political changes, which have
left me homeless and penniless, I owe every thing
to you; and so tenderly do you minister to me,
that even in this garret I could still almost fancy
myself the noble Abbess of Vatteville!"</p>

<p>As she spoke, the aged lady raised herself in
her old arm-chair, and throwing back a black
vail, disclosed features still beautiful, and a forehead
still free from every wrinkle, and eyes now
sparkling with something of their former brilliancy.
She extended her hand to Margaret, who
affectionately kissed it; and then, apprehensive
that further excitement could not but be injurious
to her mistress, the faithful creature endeavored
<a class="pagenum" id="page_614" title="pg 614"></a>
to divert her thoughts into another channel, by
inviting her to partake of the little feast provided
by the kindness of her employer. Margaret being
in the habit of taking her meals in the house
where she worked, the noble Lady Marie Anne
Adelaide de Vatteville was thus usually left alone
and unattended, to eat the scanty fare prescribed
by the extreme narrowness of her resources; so
that she now felt quite cheered by the novel comfort,
not merely of the better-spread table, but of
the company of her faithful servant; and it was
in an almost mirthful tone she said, when the repast
was ended; "Margaret, I have a secret to
confide to you. I will not&mdash;I ought not to keep
it any longer to myself."</p>

<p>"A secret, my dear mistress! a secret from
me!" exclaimed the faithful creature in a slightly
reproachful tone.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear Margaret, a secret from you; but
to be so no longer. No more henceforth of the
toils you have undergone for me; they must be
given up: I can not do without you. At my age,
to be left alone is intolerable. When you are not
near me, I get so lonely, and sometimes feel quite
afraid, I can not tell of what, but I suppose it is
natural to the old to fear; and often&mdash;will you believe
it?&mdash;I catch myself weeping like a very child.
Ah! when age comes on us, we lose all strength,
all fortitude. But you will not leave me any
more? Promise me, dear Margaret."</p>

<p>"But in that case what is to become of us?"
said Margaret.</p>

<p>"This is the very thing I have to tell. And
now listen to me. Take this key, and in the
right-hand drawer of the press you will find the
green casket, where, among my letters and family
papers, you will see a small case, which bring
to me."</p>

<p>Margaret, not a little surprised, did as she was
desired. The abbess gazed on the case for some
moments in silence, and Margaret thought she saw
a tear glisten in her eye as she pressed the box to
her lips, and kissed it tenderly and reverentially.</p>

<p>"I have sworn," said she, "never to part with
it; yet what can I do? It must be so: it is the
will of God." And with a trembling hand, as
if about to commit sacrilege, she opened the
case, and drew from it a ruby of great brilliancy
and beauty. "You see this jewel?" she said.
"Margaret, it is the glory of my ancient house;
it is the last gem in my coronet, and more precious
in my eyes than any thing in the world.
My grand-uncle, the noblest of men, the Archbishop
of Besan&ccedil;on, brought it from the East;
and when, in guerdon for some family service,
Louis XIV. founded the Abbey of Vatteville, and
made my grand-aunt the first abbess of the order,
he himself adorned her cross with it. You now
know the value of the jewel to me; and though
I can not tell its marketable value, still, notwithstanding
the pressure of the times, I can not but
think it must bring sufficient to secure us, for
some time at least, from want. Were I to consider
myself alone, I would starve sooner than
touch the sacred deposit; but to allow you, Margaret,
to suffer, and to suffer for me&mdash;to take
advantage any longer of your disinterested affection
and devoted fidelity&mdash;would be base selfishness.
God has at last taught me that I was but
sacrificing you to my pride, and I must hasten
to make atonement. I will endeavor to raise
money on this jewel. You know old M. Simon?
Notwithstanding his mean appearance and humble
mode of living, I am persuaded he is a rich
man; and though parsimonious in the extreme,
he is good-natured and obliging whenever he can
be so without any risk of loss to himself."</p>

<p>The next day, in pursuance of her project, the
abbess, accompanied by Margaret, repaired to the
house of M. Simon. "I know, sir," she said,
"from your kindness to some friends of mine,
that you feel an interest in the class to which I
belong, and that you are incapable of betraying
a confidence reposed in you. I am the Abbess
of Vatteville. Driven forth from the plundered
and ruined abbey, I am living in the town under
an assumed name. I have been stripped of every
thing; and but for the self-sacrificing attachment
of a faithful servant, I must have died of want.
However, I have still one resource, and only one.
I know not if I am right in availing myself of it,
but at my age the power to struggle fails. Besides,
I do not suffer alone; and this consideration
decides me. Will you, then, have the goodness
to give me a loan on this jewel?"</p>

<p>"I believe, madam, you have mistaken me for
a pawnbroker. I am not in the habit of advancing
money in this way. I am myself very poor,
and money is now every where scarce. I should
be very glad to be able to oblige you, but just at
present it is quite out of the question."</p>

<p>For a moment the poor abbess felt all hope extinct;
but with a last effort to move his compassion,
she said: "Oh, sir, remember that secrecy
is of such importance to me, I dare not apply
to any one else. The privacy, the obscurity in
which I live, alone has prevented me from paying
with my blood the penalty attached to a noble
name and lineage."</p>

<p>"But how am I to ascertain the value of the
jewel? I am no jeweler; and I fear, in my ignorance,
to wrong either you or myself."</p>

<p>"I implore you, sir, not to refuse me. I have
no alternative but to starve; for I am too old to
work, and beg I can not. Keep the jewel as a
pledge, and give me some relief."</p>

<p>Old Simon, though covetous, was not devoid
of feeling. He was touched by the tears of the
venerable lady; and besides, the more he looked
at the jewel, the more persuaded he became of
its being really valuable. After a few moments'
consideration, he said: "All the money I am
worth at this moment is 1500 francs; and though
I have my suspicions that I am making a foolish
bargain, I had rather run any risk than leave you
in such distress. The next time I have business
in Paris, I can ascertain the value of the jewel,
and if I have given you too little, I will make it
up to you." And with a glad and grateful heart
the abbess took home the 1500 francs, thankful
at having obtained the means of subsistence for
at least a year.
<a class="pagenum" id="page_615" title="pg 615"></a></p>

<p>Some months later, old Simon went up to
Paris, and hastening to one of the principal jewelers,
showed the ruby, and begged to know its
value. The jeweler took the stone carelessly;
but after a few moments' examination of it, he
cast a rapid glance at the thread-bare coat and
mean appearance of the possessor, and then abruptly
exclaimed: "This jewel does not belong
to you, and you must not leave the house till you
account for its being in your possession. Close
the doors," he said to his foreman, "and send for
the police." In vain did Simon protest his innocence;
in vain did he offer every proof of it.
The lapidary would listen to nothing; but at
every look he gave the gem, he darted at him a
fresh glance of angry contempt. "You must be
a fool as well as a knave," he said. "Do you
know, scoundrel, that this is the Vatteville&mdash;the
prince of rubies?&mdash;the most splendid, the rarest
of gems? It might be deemed a mere creation
of imagination, were it not enrolled and accurately
described in the archives of our art. See
here, in the <i>Guide des Lapidaires</i>, a print of it.
Mark its antique fashioning, and that dark spot!&mdash;yes,
it is indeed the precious ruby so long
thought lost. Rest assured, fellow, you shall not
quit the house until you satisfy me how you have
contrived to get possession of it."</p>

<p>"I should at once have told you, but from unwillingness
to endanger the life of a poor woman
who has confided in me. I got the jewel from
the Abbess de Vatteville herself, and it is her last
and only resource." And now M. Simon proved,
by unquestionable documents, that notwithstanding
his more than humble appearance, he was a
man of wealth and respectability, and received
the apologies which were tendered, together with
assurances that Madame Vatteville's secret was
safe with one who, he begged to say, "knew how
to respect misfortune, whenever and however presented
to his notice."</p>

<p>"But what is the jewel worth?" asked M. Simon.</p>

<p>"Millions, sir! and neither I nor any one else
in the trade here could purchase it, unless as a
joint concern, and in case of a coronation or a
marriage in one of the royal houses of Europe,
for such an occasion alone could make it not a
risk to buy it. But, meanwhile, I will, if you
wish, mention it to some of the trade."</p>

<p>"I am in no hurry," said Simon, almost bewildered
by the possession of such a treasure.
"I may as well wait for some such occasion, and,
in the mean time, can make any necessary advances
to the abbess. Perhaps I may call on you
again."</p>

<p>The first day of the year 1795 had just dawned,
and there was a thick and chilling fog. The abbess
and her faithful servant felt this day more
than usually depressed, for fifteen months had
now elapsed since the 1500 francs had been received
for the ruby, and there now remained provision
only for a few days longer. "I have got
no answer from M. Simon," said the abbess; and
in giving utterance to her own thought, she was
replying to what was at that moment passing
through Margaret's mind. "I fear he has not
been able to get more for the ruby than he thinks
fair interest for the money he advanced to me."</p>

<p>"It is most likely," said Margaret; and both
relapsed into their former desponding silence.</p>

<p>"What a dreary New-Year's Day!" resumed
Madame de Vatteville, in a melancholy tone.</p>

<p>"Oh, why can I not help you, dear mistress?"
exclaimed Margaret, suddenly starting from her
reverie. "Cheerfully would I lay down my life
for you!"</p>

<p>"And why can I not return in any way your
devoted attachment, my poor Margaret?"</p>

<p>At this instant, two loud and hurried knocks
at the door startled them both from their seats:
and it was with a trembling hand Margaret opened
it to admit the old porter, and a servant with a
letter in his hand.</p>

<p>"Thank you, thank you, M. Thiebaut: this
letter is for my mistress." But the inquisitive
old man either did not or would not understand
Margaret's hint to him to retire, and Madame de
Vatteville was obliged to tell him to leave the
room.</p>

<p>"Not a penny to bless herself with, though she
has come to a better apartment!" muttered he,
enraged at the disappointment to his curiosity&mdash;"and
yet as proud as an aristocrat!"</p>

<p>The abbess approached the casement, broke
the seal with trembling hand, and read as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>"I have at length been able to treat with a
merchant for the article in question, and have,
after much difficulty, obtained a sum of 25,000
francs&mdash;far beyond any thing I could have hoped.
But the sum is to be paid in installments, at long
intervals. It may therefore be more convenient
for you, under your peculiar circumstances, to
accept the offer I now make of a pension of 1500
francs, to revert after your decease to the servant
whom you mentioned as so devotedly attached to
you. If you are willing to accept this offer, the
bearer will hand you the necessary documents,
by which you are to make over to me all further
claim upon the property placed in my hands; and
on your affixing your signature, he will pay you
the first year in advance.</p>

<p class="author smcap">Simon."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"What a worthy, excellent man!" joyfully
exclaimed the abbess; for, in the noble integrity
of her heart, she had no suspicion that he could
take advantage of her circumstances.</p>

<p>However Simon settled the matter with his conscience,
the abbess, trained in the school of adversity
to be content with being preserved from
absolute want, passed the remainder of her life
quietly and happily with her good Margaret, both
every day invoking blessings on the head of him
whom they regarded as a generous benefactor.
Madame de Vatteville lived to the age of one hundred,
and her faithful Margaret survived only a
few months the mistress to whom she had given
such affecting proofs of attachment.</p>

<p>But Simon's detestable fraud proved of no use
to him. After keeping his treasure for several
years, he thought the emperor's coronation presented
<a class="pagenum" id="page_616" title="pg 616"></a>
a favorable opportunity of disposing of it.
Unfortunately for him, his grasping avarice one
morning suggested a thought which his ignorance
prevented his rejecting: "Since this ruby&mdash;old-fashioned
and stained as it is&mdash;can be worth so
much, what would be its value if freed from all
defect, and in modern setting?" And he soon
found a lapidary, who, for a sum of 3000 francs,
modernized it, and effaced the spot, and with it
the impress, the stamp of its antiquity&mdash;all that
gave it value, beauty, worth! This wanting, no
jeweler could recognize it: it was no longer
worth a thousand crowns.</p>

<p>It was thus that the most splendid ruby in Europe
lost its value and its fame; and its name is
now only to be found in <i>The Lapidaries' Guide</i>,
as that which had once been the most costly of
gems. It seemed as if it could not survive the
last of the illustrious house to which it owed its
introduction into Europe, and its name.</p>

<h2 id="IMPRESSIONS_OF_ENGLAND_IN_1851">IMPRESSIONS OF ENGLAND IN 1851.</h2>

<h3>FROM THE LETTERS AND MEMORANDA OF FREDRIKA BREMER.</h3>

<h3>THE CHOLERA IN LONDON.</h3>

<p class="drop">It is two years since I first found myself in
England. When I was in England in the
autumn of 1849, the cholera was there. A dense,
oppressive atmosphere rested over its cities, as
of a cloud pregnant with lightning. Hearses
rolled through the streets. The towns were
empty of people; for all who had the means of
doing so had fled into the country; they who
had not were compelled to remain. I saw shadowy
figures, clad in black, stealing along the
streets, more like ghosts than creatures of flesh
and blood. Never before had I seen human
wretchedness in such a form as I beheld it in
Hull and in London. Wretchedness enough may
be found, God knows, even in Stockholm, and it
shows itself openly enough there in street and
market. But it is there most frequently an undisguised,
an unabashed wretchedness. It is not
ashamed to beg, to show its rags or its drunken
countenance. It is a child of crime; and that is
perhaps the most extreme wretchedness. But it
is less painful to behold, because it seems to be
suffering only its own deserts. One is more
easily satisfied to turn one's head aside, and pass
on. One thinks, "I can not help that!"</p>

<p>In England, however, misery had another appearance;
it was not so much that of degradation
as of want, pallid want. It was meagre and
retiring; it ventured not to look up, or it looked
up with a glance of hopeless beseeching&mdash;so
spirit-broken! It tried to look respectable. Those
men with coats and hats brushed till the nap was
gone; those pale women in scanty, washed-out,
but yet decent clothes&mdash;it was a sight which one
could hardly bear. In a solitary walk of ten
minutes in the streets of Hull, I saw ten times
more want than I had seen in a ten months'
residence in Denmark.</p>

<p>The sun shone joyously as I traveled through
the manufacturing districts; saw their groups
of towns and suburbs; saw their smoking pillars
and pyramids towering up every where in the
wide landscape&mdash;saw glowing gorges of fire open
themselves in the earth, as if it were burning&mdash;a
splendid and wonderfully picturesque spectacle,
reminding one of fire-worshipers, of ancient
and modern times, and of their altars. But I
heard the mournful cry of the children from the
factories; the cry which the public voice has
made audible to the world; the cry of the children,
of the little ones who had been compelled,
by the lust of gain of their parents and the manufacturers,
to sacrifice life, and joy, and health
in the workshops of machinery; the children
who lie down in those beds which never are cold,
the children who are driven and beaten till they
sink insensibly into death or fatuity&mdash;that living
death; I heard the wailing cry of the children,
which Elizabeth Barrett interpreted in her affecting
poem; and the wealthy manufacturing districts,
with their towns, their fire-columns, their
pyramids, seemed to me like an enormous temple
of Moloch, in which the mammon-worshipers of
England offered up even children to the burning
arms of their god&mdash;children, the hope of the earth,
and its most delicious and most beautiful joy!</p>

<p>I arrived in London. They told me there was
nobody in London. It was not the season in
which the higher classes were in London. Besides
which, the cholera was there; and all well-to-do
people, who were able, had fled from the
infected city. And that, indeed, might be the
reason why there seemed to me to be so many
out of health&mdash;why that pale countenance of
want was so visible. Certain it is, that it became
to me as a Medusa's head, which stood between
me and every thing beautiful and great in
that great capital, the rich life and physiognomy
of which would otherwise have enchanted me.
But as it was, the palaces, and the statues, and
the noble parks, Hampstead and Piccadilly, and
Belgravia and Westminster, and the Tower, and
even the Thames itself, with all its everchanging
life, were no more than the decorations of a great
tragedy. And when, in St. Paul's, I heard the great
roar of the voice of London&mdash;that roar which, as
it is said, never is silent, but merely slumbers
for an hour between three and four o'clock in
the morning&mdash;when I heard that voice in that
empty church, where there was no divine worship,
and looked up into its beautiful cupola,
which was filled by no song of praise, but only
by that resounding, roaring voice, a dark chaotic
roar, then seemed I to perceive the sound of the
rivers of fate rolling onward through time over
falling kingdoms and people, and bearing them
onward down into an immeasurable grave!&mdash;It
was but for a moment, but it was a horrible
dream!</p>

<p>One sight I beheld in London which made me
look up with rejoicing, which made me think
"that old Ygdrasil is still budding." This was
the so-called metropolitan buildings; a structure
of many homes in one great mass of building,
erected by a society of enlightened men for the
use of the poorer working class, to provide respectable
<a class="pagenum" id="page_617" title="pg 617"></a>
families of that class with excellent
dwellings at a reasonable rate, where they might
possess that which is of the most indispensable
importance to the rich, as well as to the poor, if
they are to enjoy health both of body and soul&mdash;light,
air, and water, pure as God created them
for the use of mankind. The sight of these
homes, and of the families that inhabited them,
as well as of the newly-erected extensive public
baths and wash-houses for the same class, together
with the assurance that these institutions
already, in the second year of their establishment,
returned more than full interest to their
projectors, produced the happiest impression
which I at this time received of England.
These were to me as the seed of the future,
which gave the promise of verdant shoots in the
old tree.</p>

<p>
evertheless, when I left the shores of England,
and saw thick autumnal fog enveloping
them, it was with a sorrowful feeling for the OLD
world; and with an inquiring glance of longing
and hope, I turned myself to the NEW.</p>

<p>Two years passed on&mdash;a sun-bright, glowing
dream, full of the vigor of life!&mdash;it was again
autumn, and I was again in England. Autumn
met me there with cold, and rain, and tempest,
with the most horrible weather that can be imagined,
and such as I had never seen on the other
side of the globe. But in social life, every where
throughout the mental atmosphere, a different
spirit prevailed. There, I perceived with astonishment
and joy, there it was that of spring.</p>

<p>Free-trade had borne fruit, and under its banners
manufacture and trade had shot forth into
new life; the price of all kinds of grain had
fallen, bread had become cheap. This tree of
liberty, planted by Cobden and Peel, had, with
a strong and vigorous vitality, penetrated, as it
were, the life of the English people, and I heard
on every hand the soughing of its leaves in the
free wind. The Crystal Palace was its full-blown,
magnificent blossom&mdash;and like swarms
of rejoicing bees flew the human throng upon
the wings of steam, backward and forward, to
the great world's blossom; there all the nations
met together, there all manufactures, there all
industry, and every kind of product unfolded
their flowers for the observation and the joy of
all ... a Cactus grandiflora, such as the world
had never till then seen.</p>

<p>I perceived more clearly every day of my stay
in England, that this period is one of a general
awakening to a new, fresh life. In the manufacturing
districts, in Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham,
every where I heard the same conversation
among all classes; prosperity was universal
and still advancing. That pale countenance
of want, which had on my first visit appeared to
me so appalling, I now no longer saw as formerly;
and even where it was seen stealing along,
like a gloomy shadow near to the tables of abundance,
it appeared to me no longer as a cloud
filled with the breath of cholera, darkening the
face of heaven, but rather as one of those clouds
over which the wind and sun have power, and
which are swallowed up, which vanish in space,
in the bright ether....</p>

<h3>THE RAGGED SCHOOLS.</h3>

<p>In Liverpool I visited the so-called Ragged
Schools&mdash;the schools where are collected from
the streets vagabond, neglected, and begging
children, who are here taught to read and so on&mdash;who
here receive the first rudiments of instruction,
even in singing. These schools are, some
of them evening, others day schools, and in some
of them, "the Industrial Ragged Schools," children
are kept there altogether; receive food and
clothing, and are taught trades. When the
schools of this class were first established in
Liverpool, the number of children who otherwise
had no chance of receiving instruction, amounted
to about twenty thousand. Right-minded, thinking
men saw that in these children were growing
up in the streets, those "dangerous classes," of
which so much has been said of late times; these
men met together, obtained means to cover the
most necessary outlay of expense, and then, according
to the eloquent words of Lord Ashley,
that "it is in childhood that evil habits are formed
and take root; it is childhood which must be
guarded from temptation to crime;" they opened
these ragged schools with the design of
receiving the most friendless, the most wretched
of society's young generation&mdash;properly, "the
children of rags, born in beggary, and for beggary."</p>

<p>I visited the Industrial Ragged School for
boys, intended for the lowest grade of these little
children, without parents, or abandoned by them
to the influences of crime. There I saw the first
class sitting in their rags, upon benches in a cold
room, arranging, with their little frost-bitten fingers,
bristles for the brush-maker. The faces of
the boys were clean; many of them I remarked
were handsome, and almost universally they had
beautiful and bright eyes. Those little fingers
moved with extraordinary rapidity; the boys were
evidently wishful to do their best; they knew
that they by that means should obtain better
clothing, and would be removed to the upper
room, and more amusing employment. I observed
these "dangerous classes"&mdash;just gathered up from
the lanes, and the kennels, on their way to destruction;
and was astonished when I thought
that their countenances might have borne the
stamp of crime. Bright glances of childhood,
for that were you never designed by the Creator!
"Suffer little children to come unto me." These
words, from the lips of heaven, are forever sounding
to earth.</p>

<p>In the upper room a great number of boys
were busy pasting paper-bags for various trades,
confectioners, etc., who make use of such in the
rapid sale of their wares; here, also, other boys
were employed in printing upon the bags the
names and residences of the various tradesmen
who had ordered them. The work progressed
rapidly, and seemed very amusing to the children.
The establishment for their residence,
and their beds, were poor; but all was neat and
clean, the air was fresh, and the children were
<a class="pagenum" id="page_618" title="pg 618"></a>
cheerful. The institution was, however, but yet
in its infancy, and its means were small.</p>

<p>Half-a-dozen women, in wretched clothes, sate
in the entrance-room with their boys, for whom
they hoped to gain admittance into the school,
and were now, therefore, waiting till the directors
of the establishment made their appearance.</p>

<h3>THE POORER CLASSES.</h3>

<p>A few days later I visited some different classes
of poor people&mdash;namely, the wicked and the idle;
they who had fallen into want through their own
improvidence, but who had now raised themselves
again; and the estimable, who had honorably
combated with unavoidable poverty. In one certain
quarter of Liverpool it is that the first class
is especially met with. Of this class of poor, in
their wretched rooms, with their low, brutalized
expression, I will not speak; companion-pieces
to this misery may be met with every where.
Most of those whom I saw were Irish. It was
a Sunday noon, after divine service. The ale-houses
were already open in this part of the
town, and young girls and men might be seen
talking together before them, or sitting upon the
steps.</p>

<p>Of the second class I call to mind, with especial
pleasure, one little household. It was a
mother and her son. Her means of support, a
mangle, stood in the little room in which she had
lived since she had raised herself up again. It
was dinner-time. A table, neatly covered for
two persons, stood in the room, and upon the
iron stand before the fire was placed a dish of
mashed potatoes, nicely browned, ready to be set
on the table. The mother was waiting for her
son, and the dinner was waiting for him. He
was the organ-blower in the church during divine
service, and he returned while I was still
there. He was well dressed, but was a little,
weakly man, and squinted; the mother's eyes,
however, regarded him with love. This son was
her only one, and her all. And he, to whom
mother Nature had acted as a step-mother, had a
noble mother's heart to warm himself with, which
prepared for him an excellent home, a well-covered
table, and a comfortable bed. That poor
little home was not without its wealth.</p>

<p>As belonging to the third and highest class, I
must mention two families, both of them shoe-makers,
and both of them inhabiting cellars.
The one family consisted of old, the other of
young people. The old shoemaker had to maintain
his wife, who was lame and sick, from a
fall in the street, and a daughter. The young
one had a young wife, and five little children to
provide for; but work was scanty and the mouths
many. At this house, also, it was dinner-time,
and I saw upon the table nothing but potatoes.
The children were clean, and had remarkably
agreeable faces; but&mdash;they were pale; so was
also the father of the family. The young and
pretty, but very pale mother said, "Since I have
come into this room I have never been well, and
this I know&mdash;I shall not live long?" Her eyes
filled with tears; and it was plain enough to see
that this really delicate constitution could not
long sustain the effects of the cold damp room,
into which no sunbeam entered. These two
families, of the same trade, and alike poor, had
become friends in need. When one of the fathers
of the family wanted work, and was informed
by the Home-missionary who visited them that
the other had it, the intelligence seemed a consolation
to him. Gladdening sight of human
sympathy, which keeps the head erect and the
heart sound under the depressing struggle against
competition! But little gladdening to me would
have been the sight of these families in their
cellar-homes, had I not at the same time been
aware of the increase of those "Model Lodging-houses,"
which may be met with in many parts
of England, and which will remove these inhabitants
of cellars, they who sit in darkness, into
the blessing of the light of life&mdash;which will provide
worthy dwellings for worthy people.</p>

<h3>BEE-HIVES.</h3>

<p>In my imagination Manchester was like a colossal
woman sitting at her spinning-wheel, with
her enormous manufactories; her subject towns,
suburbs, villages, factories, lying for many miles
round, spinning, spinning, spinning clothes for
all the people on the face of the earth. And
there, as she sate, the queen of the spindle, with
her masses of ugly houses and factories, enveloped
in dense rain-clouds, as if in cobwebs, the
effect she made upon me was gloomy and depressing.
Yet even here, also, I was to breathe
a more refreshing atmosphere of life; even here
was I also to see light. Free trade had brought
hither her emancipating spirit. It was a time
of remarkable activity and prosperity. The workpeople
were fully employed; wages were good,
and food was cheap. Even here also had ragged-schools
been established, together with many
institutions for improving the condition of the
poor working-classes. In one of these ragged-schools
the boys had a perfectly organized band
of music, in which they played and blew, so that
it was a pleasure&mdash;and sometimes a disadvantage
to hear them. The lamenting "cry of the children"
was no longer heard from the factories.
Government had put an end to the cruelties and
oppressions formerly practiced on these little ones
by the unscrupulous lust of gain. No child under
ten years old can now be employed in the
factories, and even such, when employed, must
of necessity be allowed part of the day for school.
Every large factory has now generally its own
school, with a paid master for the children. The
boys whom I saw in the great rooms of the factories,
and with whom I conversed, looked both
healthy and cheerful.</p>

<p>Two ideas were impressed upon my mind at
this place: how dangerous it is, even amid a
high degree of social culture, to give one class of
men unrestrained power over another; and how
easily a free people, with a powerful public spirit
and accustomed to self-government, can raise
themselves out of humiliating circumstances.
This spirit has done much already in England,
but it has yet more to do.</p>

<p>Upon one of those large gloomy factories in
<a class="pagenum" id="page_619" title="pg 619"></a>
Manchester, I read, inscribed in iron letters,
"<span class="smcap">The great Beehive</span>;" and in truth a good
name for these enormous hives of human industrial
toil, in which people have sometimes forgotten,
and still forget, that man is any thing more
than a working bee, which lives to fill its cell in
the hive and die. I visited several of these huge
beehives. In one of them which employed twelve
hundred work-people, I saw, in a large room,
above three hundred women sitting in rows winding
cotton on reels. The room was clean, and
so also were all the women. It did not appear
to be hard work; but the steadfastly-fixed attention
with which these women pursued their
labor seemed to me distressingly wearisome.
They did not allow themselves to look up, still
less to turn their heads or to talk. Their life
seemed to depend upon the cotton thread.</p>

<p>In another of these great beehives, a long low
room, in which were six hundred power-looms,
represented an extraordinary appearance. What
a snatching to and fro, what a jingling, what an
incessant stir, and what a moist atmosphere
there was between floor and ceiling, as if the
limbs of some absurd, unheard-of beast, with a
thousand arms, had been galvanized! Around
us, from three to four hundred operatives, women
and men, stood among the rapid machinery,
watching and tending. The twelve o'clock bell
rung, and now the whole throng of work-people
would go forth to their various mid-day quarters;
the greatest number to their respective dwellings
in the neighborhood of the factory. I placed
myself, together with my conductor, in the court
outside the door of the room, which was on lower
ground, in order that I might have a better
view of the work-people as they came out.</p>

<p>Just as one sees bees coming out of a hive
into the air, two, three, or four at a time&mdash;pause,
as it were, a moment from the effects of open
air and light, and then with a low hum, dart
forth into space, each one his own way; so was
it in this case. Thus came they forth, men and
women, youths and girls. The greater number
were well dressed, looked healthy, and full of
spirit. In many, however, might be seen the
expression of a rude life; they bore the traces
of depravity about them.</p>

<h3>THE ROYAL FAMILY.</h3>

<p>The Queen and her husband stand before the
people as the personation of every domestic and
public virtue! The Queen is an excellent wife
and mother; she attends to the education of her
children, and fulfills her duties as sovereign, alike
conscientiously. She is an early riser; is punctual
and regular in great as well as in small
things. She pays ready money for all that she
purchases, and never is in debt to any one. Her
court is remarkable for its good and beautiful
morals. On their estate, she and Prince Albert
carry every thing out in the best manner, establish
schools and institutions for the good of the
poor; these institutions and arrangements of
theirs serve as examples to every one. Their
uprightness, kindness, generosity, and the tact
which they under all circumstances display, win
the heart of the nation. They show a warm
sympathy for the great interests of the people,
and by this very sympathy are they promoted.
Of this, the successful carrying out of free trade,
and the Exhibition in the Crystal Palace, projected
in the first instance by Prince Albert, and
powerfully seconded by the Queen, furnish brilliant
examples. The sympathies of the Queen
are those of the heart as well as of the head.
When that noble statesman, the great promoter
of free-trade, Sir Robert Peel, died, the Queen
shut herself in for several days, and wept for
him as if she had lost a father. And whenever
a warm sympathy is called forth, either in public
or in private affairs it is warmly and fully participated
by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert.
That which the English people require from their
rulers, is not merely formal government, but a
living interest in their affairs.</p>

<h3>BIRMINGHAM AND THE CHARTISTS.</h3>

<p>From Manchester I traveled to Birmingham.
I saw again the land of the fire-worshipers, their
smoking altars, in tall columns and pyramids,
towering above the green fields; saw again the
burning gulfs yawning in the earth, and&mdash;saw
them now with unmixed pleasure. I heard no
longer, amid their boiling roar, the lamenting cry
of the children; I heard and saw them now only
as the organs of the public prosperity, and rejoiced
over them as proofs of man's power over
fire and water, over all the powers of nature;
the victory of the gods over the giants!</p>

<p>The sun burst forth from between rain-clouds
as I arrived in Birmingham, England's&mdash;nay, the
world's&mdash;workshop of steel-pens, nails, steel, tin,
and brass wares of all kinds.</p>

<p>If Manchester is a colossal woman at her spinning-wheel,
then is Birmingham a colossal smith.</p>

<p>In Birmingham I visited a steel-pen manufactory,
and followed from room to room the whole
process of those small metal tongues which go
abroad over all the world and do so much&mdash;evil,
and so much good; so much that is great, so
much that is small; so much that is important,
so much that is trivial. I saw four hundred young
girls sitting in large, light rooms, each with her
little pen-stamp, employed in a dexterous and
easy work, especially fitted for women. All
were well dressed, seemed healthy and cheerful,
many were pretty; upon the whole, it was a
spectacle of prosperity which surpassed even
that of the mill-girls in the celebrated factories
of Lowell in North America.</p>

<p>Birmingham was at this time in a most flourishing
condition, and had more orders for goods
than it could supply, nor were there any male
paupers to be found in the town; there was full
employment for all.</p>

<p>In Birmingham I saw a large school of design.
Not less than two hundred young female artists
studied here in a magnificent hall or rotunda,
abundantly supplied with models of all kinds,
and during certain hours in the week exclusively
opened to these female votaries of art. A clever,
respectable old woman, the porter of the school-house,
spoke of many of these with especial
<a class="pagenum" id="page_620" title="pg 620"></a>
pleasure, as if she prided herself on them in
some degree.</p>

<p>I saw in Birmingham a beautiful park, with
hot-houses, in which were tropical plants, open
to the public; saw also a large concert-room,
where twice in the week "glees" were sung,
and to which the public were admitted at a low
price: all republican institutions, and which seem
to prosper more in a monarchical realm than in
republics themselves.</p>

<p>From Birmingham I had determined to go for
a few days to Stratford-on-Avon, before I went
to London in order to secure a view of the Great
Exhibition, the last week of which was at hand.
I was, therefore, obliged to leave the manufacturing
districts earlier than I wished; but before
quitting them on paper, I must say a few words
on their population, on their artisans, etc.</p>

<p>These belong almost entirely to the class of
what are called Chartists; that is, advocates of
universal suffrage. They are this, through good
and through evil; and the resistance which their
just desire to be more fully represented in the
legislative body, has met with from that body,
has brought them more and more into collision
with the power of the state, more and more to
base their demands in opposition, even to the
higher principles of justice: for they overlook
the duty of rendering themselves worthy of the
franchise by sound education. But the fault
here, in the first place, was not theirs. Growing
up amid machinery and the hum of labor,
without schools, without religious or moral worth;
hardened by hard labor, in continual fight with
the difficulties of life, they have moulded themselves
into a spirit little in harmony with life's
higher educational influences, the blessings of
which they had never experienced. Atheism,
radicalism, republicanism, socialism of all kinds
will and must nourish here in concealment among
the strong and daily augmenting masses of a
population, restrained only by the fear of the
still more mighty powers which may be turned
against them, and by labor for their daily needs,
so long as those powers are sufficing. And perhaps
the American slave-states are right when
they say, in reference to this condition of things,
"England lies at our feet&mdash;England can not do
without our cotton. If the manufacturers of
England must come to a stand, then has she a
popular convulsion at her door." Perhaps it may
be so; for these hosts of manufacturing workmen,
neglected in the beginning by society,
neglected by church and state, look upon them
merely as exacting and despotic powers; and in
strict opposition to them, they have banded together,
and established schools for their own
children, where only the elements of practical
science are admitted, and from which religious
and moral instruction are strictly excluded. In
truth, a volcanic foundation for society, and which
now, for some time past, has powerfully arrested
the attention of the most thinking men of England.</p>

<p>But into the midst of this menacing chaos light
has already begun to penetrate with an organizing power;
and over the dark profound hovers
a spirit which can and will divide the darkness
from the light, and prepare a new creation.</p>

<p>I sought the manufacturing towns from a
sense of duty, and the commands of conscience.
I was anxious to see this side of human life.
But this done, I thought I might do something
for my own pleasure. I was in England chiefly
for this purpose. I must follow the impulse of
my heart; I must make a pilgrimage to the
grave of Shakspeare. For the older I have become,
the more that I have lived and learned,
the more valuable have two good artists become
to me&mdash;the more have I had to thank&mdash;Beethoven
and Shakspeare.</p>

<p>From Birmingham I traveled, on the morning
of the fourth of October, by the railway to Leamington,
and thence, alone in a little carriage, to
Stratford-on-Avon.</p>

<h2 id="TRUE_COURAGE_A_TALE_OF_TATTERSHALL">
TRUE COURAGE.&mdash;A TALE OF TATTERSHALL CASTLE.</h2>

<p class="drop">In the summer vacation of 183-, a party of gay
young collegians visited Tattershall Castle,
in Lincolnshire. This remarkably noble ruin
consists of a single lofty keep, rising to the
height of two hundred feet, the interior being
open from summit to basement. Mighty oaken
beams once, however, spanned the massive walls,
supporting floors which formed stories of varying
height. Many of these beams have fallen to
the basement, completely rotten, through shameful
exposure to the weather ever since the roof
crumbled away; others still pertinaciously hang,
more or less broken and decayed, but, in a majority
of instances, seem as if a strong gust of
eddying wind would send them down crashing,
to mingle their fragments with those already
mouldering below.</p>

<p>The party were in high spirits. They had
drunk old wines, and their young blood flowed
hotly in their veins; they had laughed, joked,
and talked themselves into wild excitement.
About half way up to the castle turrets there is
a sort of open landing, which goes along one
wall of the structure; and on to this landing the
party stepped from the grand spiral staircase
they had hitherto been ascending, and there
paused a moment to look about them. The
scene was striking. A few beams sprung across
just below their feet; a few thick-moted rays of
sun pierced through the adjoining loop-holes; a
few fleecy cloudlets flitted athwart the blue ether
high overhead. Startled by the noisy visitors,
a number of dusky jackdaws flew out of their
holes up and down the walls, and, after chattering
their decided disapprobation of being disturbed,
made half-a-dozen whirling circuits of
the interior, rising rapidly upward, until they
disappeared.</p>

<p>Immediately afterward, a great white owl projected
its visage from a hole close above where
one of the beams joined the opposite wall, and,
frightedly peering with its great dazzled eyes,
the harmless creature bewilderedly popped from
its hole on to the beam, and having made a few
<a class="pagenum" id="page_621" title="pg 621"></a>
feeble flutterings with its wings, remained quite
stationary, crouched in a ball-like figure, close
to the wall.</p>

<p>"Oh, Deschamp," exclaimed one of the party
to a friend at his side, who was plucking the
long gray moss of a peculiar species, which literally
clothes the castle walls inside and out,
"look yonder at Minerva's bird."</p>

<p>"Ha! ha!" chorused the company&mdash;"a veritable
owl!"</p>

<p>Thereupon one and all began picking up bits
of brick and mortar from where they stood, and
threw them at the bird with various degrees of
skill. One or two bits even struck it, but so far
from being roused thereby, the owl merely gave
one boding, long-drawn, sepulchral screech, and,
contracting its ghastly outline into still smaller
compass, fairly buried its broad visage between
the meeting bony tips of its wings.</p>

<p>"What a stupid creature! hoo! horoo!"
shouted they, thinking by that means to induce
it to fly. But the outcry only terrified the bird
to such a degree, that it stuck its claws convulsively
into the decayed timber, and stirred
not at all.</p>

<p>"It's the way o' them creeturs," here said the
guide, who was showing the party over the castle;
"they're about the stupidest things in creation,
I'm a thinking!"</p>

<p>"Humph!" muttered Lord Swindon, a handsome,
athletic young man of twenty, "with such
an example before our eyes, we can not but admit
your opinion to be highly philosophic and
indisputable. But I say, old fellow," added he,
tapping the guide familiarly on the shoulder with
the light riding switch he carried in his hand,
"is <i>that</i> beam a rotten one?"</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> shouldn't be over-for'ard to trust myself on
it, sir," replied the man&mdash;a fat dumpy personage.</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> wouldn't! No. I should rather think
not," responded Lord Swindon, a smile of supreme
disdain sweeping across his features, as
he surveyed the "old fellow" from head to foot.
"But, tell me, did you ever know <i>any body</i> walk
upon it, eh?"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, yes. Only last summer, a young
Oxonian ran from end to end of it, as I seed with
my own eyes."</p>

<p>"Did he?"</p>

<p>"True," put in Deschamp. "I remember
now, it was young Manners of Brazennose; and
didn't he brag about it!"</p>

<p>"Him!" exclaimed Lord Swindon, with a toss
of the head; "that fellow, poor milksop? Not,"
continued he, hastily, "that it is any thing of a
feat. Pooh!"</p>

<p>"Not a feat!" murmured his companions;
and, with one accord, they stretched forth their
necks, and, gazing down the dim abyss, shuddered
at what they beheld. Well they might.
The beam in question rose at a height of about
one hundred feet, and naught beneath it was
there but a gloomy chasm, only broken in one
or two places by crumbling beams, and not one
even of these was by many feet near it. "Oh,
Swindon, how can you say so?"</p>

<p>"I can say it, and I do," snappishly replied
the fiery young man, his brain heated with wine;
"and, at any rate, what that fellow Manners has
done, I can do. So look out!"</p>

<p>Thus speaking, he recklessly stepped on the
beam, and, despite the remonstrances of his companions,
was in the act of proceeding along it,
when his arm was firmly grasped, and a low,
deep-toned voice exclaimed, "My lord, do you
court a horrible death? Do not thus risk your
life for naught."</p>

<p>The individual who thus unhesitatingly interfered
was evidently unknown to all present, being
a casual visitor to the castle, who had just
joined the group. With an imprecation, the
madcap youngster jerked his arm away, and
sprang forward along the beam. Its surface was
rough, rounded, and uneven; and as he ran
along, swerving from side to side, every instant
in danger of being precipitated downward, with
the awful certainty of being dashed to pieces, his
friends could hardly restrain themselves from
shrieking with terror, though such a course
would probably have had the immediate effect
of discomposing the equilibrium of their rash
companion, and so inducing the catastrophe they
fully anticipated, without the power of prevention.
Had the adventurer's presence of mind
one moment failed&mdash;had his self-possession and
confidence wavered or forsaken him&mdash;had his
brain sickened, or his eyes turned dim for a single
second&mdash;had he made the least false step&mdash;had
his footing slipped on the slimy surface of
the beam&mdash;had he tripped against any of the
knots projecting from the rotten wood which had
mouldered away around them&mdash;at once would he
have been hurled into dread eternity.</p>

<p>But an unseen hand sustained him, and safely
he reached the extremity of the beam, ruthlessly
wrenched the trembling owl from its perch, waved
it aloft in triumph, and then, with a proud ejaculation,
began to retrace his steps, with it shrieking
and fluttering in his hands. When he reached
the centre of the frail beam, which creaked and
bent terribly with his comparatively small weight,
he paused, drew himself up to his full height&mdash;air
above, air beneath, air all around, naught but
air&mdash;and deliberately tore the head of the owl by
main force from its body. Having perpetrated
this cruel deed, he tossed the bloody head among
the breathless spectators, and sharply dashed the
writhing body into the void beneath his feet.
He coolly watched its descent, until it lay a shapeless
mass on the stones below; then, with slow,
bravadoing mien, he walked back to his terrified
party, and boastingly demanded of them whether
they thought "Manners could beat that?"</p>

<p>"My lord," solemnly said the stranger, "you
have not performed the act either of a brave or a
sane man, and you have committed a despicable
deed on one of God's helpless creatures. You
ought to thank Him, my lord, from the depth of
your soul, that he saved you from the penalty
you incurred."</p>

<p>"What do you say?" fiercely demanded Lord
Swindon. "Do you dare to insinuate cowardice
<a class="pagenum" id="page_622" title="pg 622"></a>
against me?" and with flashing brow, he assumed
a threatening attitude.</p>

<p>"I know not, my lord, whether you are brave
or not, but what I have witnessed was certainly
not an exercise of true courage," was the passionless
reply.</p>

<p>"And yet I'll wager a cool thousand that you
daren't do it."</p>

<p>"True, I dare not: for I am incapable of offering
a deadly insult to my Maker."</p>

<p>"Fine words!" Then, carried away by the excitement
of the moment, he added, with an insolent
look and gesture, "You are a lying coward."</p>

<p>"Listen, my lord," answered the person thus
addressed, and this time his tone was even calmer
than before. "One year ago, you were walking
at the midnight hour on the pier at the sea-port
of Hull, and but one other person was upon it,
and he was a stranger to you. You trod too
near the edge of the pier, and fell into the sea.
The tempest was howling, and the tide was high
and running strongly; and, ere you could utter
more than one smothered cry, it had swept you
many yards away, and you were sinking rapidly.
Except God, none but that stranger heard your
cry of agony; and, soon as it reached his ear, he
looked forth upon the waters, and, catching a
glimpse of your struggling form, he instantly
plunged in, and, after much diving, eventually
grasped you at a great depth. Long did he support
your helpless body, and stoutly did he buffet
the stifling waves, and loudly did he call for aid.
At length help came; and at the last moment, he
and you were saved just in time for life to be
preserved in both. Is not this true, my lord?"</p>

<p>"It is," emphatically responded the young
nobleman; "but what have you to do with it?
I don't know you&mdash;though it is not at all wonderful,"
added he, with a sneer, "that you should
happen to know about the matter, for the newspapers
blazoned it quite sufficiently."</p>

<p>"My lord, one question more. Did you ever
learn who that stranger was who, under God,
saved your life?"</p>

<p>"No; when I recovered a little, he left me at
the hotel, where he was unknown, and I have
never seen him since."</p>

<p>"Then, my lord," was the startling rejoinder,
"look well at me, for I am that stranger."</p>

<p>"You?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I whom you have branded as a liar
and a coward. Little thought I that the life I
saved at the imminent risk of my own would be
madly, wickedly jeopardized for no price whatever,
as I have seen it this hour. Mine, my lord,
was true courage; yours was false. Henceforth
know the difference between them. Farewell."</p>

<p>So saying, the stranger bowed, and before another
word could be uttered, had left the astounded
party.</p>

<h2 id="INTRODUCTION_OF_THE_POTATO_INTO">
INTRODUCTION OF THE POTATO INTO FRANCE.</h2>

<p class="drop">In that rational estimate of true greatness
which men are daily becoming more inclined
to form, names will yet rank high as those of the
benefactors of mankind, which history has too
long suffered to give place to those of heroes (so
called), who might be better designated as the
destroyers of national prosperity, the scourges
of their country. Among the names of such
benefactors, that of Antoine-Augustin Parmentier
well deserves to be handed down to the gratitude
of posterity. He was born in the little
town of Montdidier, in 1737, of poor but respectable
parents; and, having lost his father before
he was three years old, he was brought up altogether
by his mother, a woman of considerable
intelligence, and in refinement of character far
beyond her station; and to her he owed much
of that religious feeling and steadiness of principle
which stamped such value in after-life upon the
ardent disposition and spirit of enterprise which
were natural to him. The good cur&eacute; of the place,
who had long known and esteemed his parents,
had an opportunity of observing the uncommon
intelligence of the boy, and undertook to teach
him the rudiments of Latin. At sixteen, the
young Augustin, anxious to be no longer a burden
to his mother, placed himself with an apothecary
of his native town; but the following year
he repaired to Paris, invited thither by a relative,
to study under him the profession he had chosen.</p>

<p>It was not long before prospects of advancement
opened to the young medical student. The
war of Hanover broke out, and, in 1757, Parmentier,
attached to the medical staff, though in
a very subordinate post, joined the army. It was
not long before he had opportunity to prove his
skill and zealous devotion to his duties. A dreadful
epidemic appeared among the French soldiery,
and tested to the utmost his unwearied activity
and unceasing attention to his duties. His services
were acknowledged by his being promoted
to the rank of assistant-apothecary. His dauntless
exposure of himself on the field of battle
caused him to be five times taken prisoner&mdash;a
misfortune to which he afterward often made
mirthful allusion; extolling the dexterity with
which the Prussian hussars had more than once
stripped him, and declaring that they were the
best valets de chambre he had ever met.</p>

<p>It was while prisoner of war on one of these
occasions that Parmentier first conceived the idea
which was destined to give him a claim upon the
gratitude of his country. The prisoners were
kept in very close confinement, and fed altogether
on potatoes; but Parmentier, instead of joining
his companions in misfortune in their indignant
abuse of a food altogether new to them, was
calmly and sensibly engaged in reflecting on the
utility of the vegetable, and in inquiring into its
nature, and the mode of cultivating it. We shall
see how he kept the resolution he then formed
of not letting it escape his memory, should he
ever be permitted to revisit his native country.</p>

<p>Peace being declared, he was released, and
came back to Paris in 1763, where he attended
the Abbe Mollet's course of natural philosophy,
the chemical course of the Brothers Douille, and
the botanical lectures of the celebrated Bernard
de Jussieu. At this time, however, his poverty
<a class="pagenum" id="page_623" title="pg 623"></a>
was so great, that he had to endure the severest
privations, to enable him to pay the necessary
fees, and to purchase such books as he required,
without interfering with the pecuniary aid which
he felt it alike his duty and his privilege to afford
his mother. In 1766, he became a candidate for
a situation as medical attendant at the Hotel des
Invalides, and was almost unanimously elected.
In this position, he gave the utmost satisfaction;
and not only did the skill he displayed obtain for
him professional reputation, but his playful, yet
never satirical wit, and the charm of his gentle
and affectionate disposition, made him a universal
favorite. He was the object of respectful attachment
to the disabled veterans, and also to the
good Sisters of Charity who attended the hospital.
In 1769, he received, as the reward of
his labors, the appointment of apothecary-in-chief,
which permanently fixed him in the Hotel
des Invalides. With a little more leisure, and
comparative freedom from pecuniary care, came
back the recollection of his former plans with regard
to the potato. This now well-known and
almost universally-used tubercle had been introduced
into Europe from Peru early in the sixteenth
century, and had at once been cultivated
in Italy and Germany. Brought from Flanders
into France, its culture was promoted in the
southern provinces by the encouragement given
by the great Turgot; but the dogged pertinacity
with which ignorance so often resists the introduction
of any thing new, had in every other
part of the kingdom interfered with its propagation.
Indeed, the popular prejudice against it
was so high as to lead to the belief that it had a
baleful effect on any soil in which it was planted,
and produced in those who used it as food leprosy
and other loathsome diseases. Such were
the absurd and groundless prejudices which Parmentier
had to encounter, but he prepared himself
to carry on the contest with the boldness
and perseverance of one who knew that, however
difficult it may be to struggle with old opinions
and long-established customs, yet nothing is impossible
to the spirit of enterprise, guided by
sound judgment, and animated by genuine philanthropy.
Parmentier was not unmindful that
to attain his object he would, in the first instance,
need high patronage; and this patronage he
sought and found in no less a personage than
Louis XVI. himself. At his earnest solicitation,
the monarch placed at his disposal, as a field for
his experiment, fifty acres of the Plaine des Sablons.
For the first time, this sterile soil was
tilled by Parmentier, and the plant he so ardently
desired to naturalize committed to it. In due
time the long-wished-for blossoms appeared. Almost
wondering at his success, Parmentier eagerly
gathered a bouquet of the flowers, more precious
to him than the rarest exotic in the royal
gardens, and hastened to Versailles, to present
them to the king. Louis accepted the offering
most graciously, and, notwithstanding the satirical
smiles of some of his courtiers, wore them
in his button-hole.</p>

<p>From that hour the triumph of the potato was
secured. The nobles and fine ladies, who had
hitherto laughed at what they called "the poor
man's monomania," now took their tone from the
monarch, and flocked round the modest philanthropist
with their congratulations. Guards
placed round the field excited the curiosity of the
people; but as this was a precaution rather against
the pressure of the crowd than against its cupidity,
they were withdrawn at night, and soon it
was announced to Parmentier that his potatoes
had been stolen. His delight at this intelligence
was extreme, and he bountifully rewarded the
bearer of the news; for he saw in this theft a
proof of his complete success. "There can
scarcely be any remaining prejudice against my
poor potatoes," he said, "else they would not be
stolen." A short time after he gave a dinner,
every dish of which consisted of the potato disguised
in some variety of form, and even the
liquids used at table were extracted from it.
Among other celebrated persons, Franklin and
Lavoisier were present. And thus, to the persevering
efforts of one individual was France indebted
for a vegetable which soon took its place
in the first rank of its agricultural treasures. By
naturalizing the potato in that country, Parmentier
diffused plenty among thousands, once the
hapless victims of privation and misery during
the seasons of scarcity hitherto frequently recurring
to desolate its provinces.</p>

<p>From 1783 to 1791, Parmentier occupied himself
in the publication of several works of great
merit upon domestic economy and agriculture.
But now came on the evil days of the Revolution.
From prudence, natural inclination, and engrossment
in other pursuits, Parmentier took no part
in the political storm then raging. His moderation
was regarded as a protest against the principles
then in the ascendant. The man who had
just rendered the most signal service to the people
became an object of persecution to those calling
themselves the friends of the people. "Talk
not to me of this Parmentier," said an infuriate
club orator; "he would give us nothing to eat
but potatoes. I ask you, was it not he that invented
them?" His name was put into the list
of the suspected, and he was deprived not only
of the small pension allowed him by Louis XVI.,
but also of his situation at the Hotel des Invalides.
However, when the coalition of all Europe
forced France to avail herself to the utmost of
her every resource, it was found expedient to reorganize
the medical department of the military
hospitals, and to improve the diet of the soldiery;
and Parmentier being fixed on for this difficult
task, his success amply justified the choice. His
reputation for skill and talent increasing with
every test to which he was put, he was successively
placed on the sanitary commission for the
department of the Seine, and on the general committee
of civil hospitals. Diplomas were sent to
him by all the learned societies, and he was enrolled
a member of the National Institute.</p>

<p>Parmentier lived throughout the period of the
Empire, honored and esteemed by all classes;
but, in 1813, grief for the loss of a beloved sister
<a class="pagenum" id="page_624" title="pg 624"></a>
added to his deep dejection at the reverses of the
French arms, seriously affected his health. His
patriotism could not but deeply feel the evils
threatening his country from foreign invasion.
He became dangerously ill, and on the 13th of
December the cause of social progress lost by his
death one of its most zealous and enlightened
promoters. In a discourse pronounced on the
occasion before the Pharmaceutic Association,
Cadet de Gassicour dwelt principally on the two
great benefits conferred by Parmentier&mdash;the use
of the potato, and the introduction of the Sirop
de Raisin, thus providing, according to the benevolent
boast of the philanthropist himself,
"the poor man's bread, and the poor man's
sugar." During his lifetime, a proposal had been
made by the Minister Fran&ccedil;ois de Neufchateau
that the potato should be called <i>Parmenti&egrave;re</i>. It
is to be regretted that a proposal which would
have secured a memorial as inexpensive as it
was appropriate, was rejected; one which would
have indissolubly linked in the minds of every
Frenchman the name of the benefactor with the
benefit.</p>

<h2 id="THE_ARTISTS_SACRIFICE">THE ARTIST'S SACRIFICE.</h2>

<p class="drop">On a cold evening in January&mdash;one of those
dark and gloomy evenings which fill one with
sadness&mdash;there sat watching by the bed of a sick
man, in a little room on the fifth floor, a woman
of about forty, and two pretty children&mdash;a boy of
twelve and a little girl of eight. The exquisite
neatness of the room almost concealed its wretchedness:
every thing announced order and economy,
but at the same time great poverty. A
painted wooden bedstead, covered with coarse but
clean calico sheets, blue calico curtains, four
chairs, a straw arm-chair, a high desk of dark
wood, with a few books and boxes placed on
shelves, composed the entire furniture of the
room. And yet the man who lay on that wretched
bed, whose pallid cheek, and harsh, incessant
cough, foretold the approach of death, was one
of the brightest ornaments of our literature. His
historical works had won for him a European
celebrity, his writings having been translated into
all the modern languages; yet he had always remained
poor, because his devotion to science had
prevented him from devoting a sufficient portion
of his time to productive labor.</p>

<p>An unfinished piece of costly embroidery thrown
on a little stand near the bed, another piece of a
less costly kind, but yet too luxurious to be intended
for the use of this poor family, showed
that his wife and daughter&mdash;this gentle child,
whose large dark eyes were so full of sadness&mdash;endeavored
by the work of their hands to make
up for the unproductiveness of his efforts. The
sick man slept, and the mother, taking away the
lamp and the pieces of embroidery, went with her
children into the adjoining room, which served
both as ante-chamber and dining-room: she seated
herself at the table, and took up her work with
a sad and abstracted air; then observing her little
daughter doing the same thing cheerfully, and her
son industriously coloring some prints destined
for a book of fashions, she embraced them; and
raising her tearful eyes toward heaven, she seemed
to be thanking the Almighty, and, in the midst
of her affliction, to be filled with gratitude to Him
who had blessed her with such children.</p>

<p>Soon after, a gentle ring was heard at the door,
and M. Raymond, a young doctor, with a frank,
pleasing countenance, entered and inquired for
the invalid.</p>

<p>"Just the same, doctor," said Madame G&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>The young man went into the next room, and
gazed for some moments attentively on the sleeper,
while the poor wife fixed her eyes on the
doctor's countenance, and seemed there to read
her fate.</p>

<p>"Is there no hope, doctor?" she asked, in a
choking voice, as she conducted him to the other
room. The doctor was silent, and the afflicted
mother embraced her children and wept. After
a pause, she said: "There is one idea which
haunts me continually: I should wish so much
to have my husband's likeness. Do you know of
any generous and clever artist, doctor? Oh, how
much this would add to the many obligations you
have already laid me under!"</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, I am not acquainted with a
single artist," replied the young doctor.</p>

<p>"I must then renounce this desire," said Madame
G&mdash;&mdash;, sighing.</p>

<p>The next morning Henry&mdash;so the little boy was
called&mdash;having assisted his mother and his sister
Marie in their household labors, dressed himself
carefully, and, as it was a holiday, asked leave to
go out.</p>

<p>"Go, my child," said his mother; "go and
breathe a little fresh air: your continual work is
injurious to you."</p>

<p>The boy kissed his father's wasted hand, embraced
his mother and sister, and went out, at
once sad and pleased. When he reached the
street he hesitated for a moment, then directed
his steps toward the drawing-school where he attended
every day: he entered, and rung at the
door of the apartment belonging to the professor
who directed this academy. A servant opened
the door, and conducted him into an elegantly-furnished
breakfast-room; for the professor was
one of the richest and most distinguished painters
of the day. He was breakfasting alone with
his wife when Henry entered.</p>

<p>"There, my dear," he said to her, as he perceived
Henry; "there is the cleverest pupil in
the academy. This little fellow really promises
to do me great credit one day. Well, my little
friend, what do you wish to say to me?"</p>

<p>"Sir, my father is very ill&mdash;the doctor fears
that he may die: poor mamma, who is very fond
of papa, wishes to have his portrait. Would you,
sir, be kind enough to take it? O do not, pray
sir, do not refuse me!" said Henry, whose tearful
eyes were fixed imploringly on the artist.</p>

<p>"Impossible, Henry&mdash;impossible!" replied the
painter. "I am paid three thousand francs for
every portrait I paint, and I have five or six at
present to finish."</p>

<p>"But, my dear," interposed his wife, "it
<a class="pagenum" id="page_625" title="pg 625"></a>
seems to me that this portrait would take you but
little time: think of the poor mother, whose husband
will so soon be lost to her forever."</p>

<p>"It grieves me to refuse you, my dear; but
you know that my battle-piece, which is destined
for Versailles, must be sent to the Louvre in a
fortnight, for I can not miss the Exposition this
year. But stay, my little friend, I will give you
the address of several of my pupils: tell them I
sent you, and you will certainly find some one of
them who will do what you wish. Good-morning,
Henry!"</p>

<p>"Good-by, my little friend," added the lady.
"I hope you may be successful." The boy took
his leave with a bursting heart.</p>

<p>Henry wandered through the gardens of the
Luxembourg, debating with himself if he should
apply to the young artists whose addresses he
held in his hand. Fearing that his new efforts
might be equally unsuccessful, he was trying to
nerve himself to encounter fresh refusals, when
he was accosted by a boy of his own age, his
fellow-student at the drawing-school. Jules proposed
that they should walk together; then observing
Henry's sadness, he asked him the cause.
Henry told him of his mother's desire; their master's
refusal to take the portrait; and of his own
dislike to apply to those young artists, who were
strangers to him.</p>

<p>"Come with me," cried Jules, when his friend
had ceased speaking. "My sister is also an artist:
she has always taken care of me, for our
father and mother died when we were both very
young. She is so kind and so fond of me, that I
am very sure she will not refuse."</p>

<p>The two boys traversed the Avenue de l'Observatoire,
the merry, joyous face of the one contrasting
with the sadness and anxiety of the other.
When they got to the end of the avenue they entered
the Rue de l'Ouest, and went into a quiet-looking
house, up to the fourth story of which
Jules mounted with rapid steps, dragging poor
Henry with him. He tapped gayly at a little
door, which a young servant opened: he passed
through the ante-chamber, and the two boys found
themselves in the presence of Emily d'Orbe, the
sister of Jules.</p>

<p>She appeared to be about twenty-five: she
was not tall, and her face was rather pleasing
than handsome; yet her whole appearance indicated
cultivation and amiability. Her dress was
simple, but exquisitely neat; her gown of brown
stuff fitted well to her graceful figure; her linen
cuffs and collar were of a snowy whiteness; her
hair was parted in front, and fastened up behind
<i>&agrave; l'antique</i>: but she wore no ribbon, no ornament&mdash;nothing
but what was necessary. The
furniture of the room, which served at the same
time as a sitting-room and studio, was equally
simple: a little divan, some chairs, and two arm-chairs
covered with gray cloth, a round table,
a black marble time-piece of the simplest form;
two engravings, the "Spasimo di Sicilia" and
the "Three Maries," alone ornamented the walls;
green blinds were placed over the windows, not
for ornament, but to moderate the light, according
to the desire of the artist; finally, three easels,
on which rested some unfinished portraits, and a
large painting representing Anna Boleyn embracing
her daughter before going to execution.</p>

<p>When he entered, little Jules went first to
embrace his sister; she tenderly returned his
caresses, then said to him in a gentle voice, as
she returned to her easel: "Now, my dear child,
let me go on with my painting;" not, however,
without addressing a friendly "Good-morning"
to Henry, who, she thought, had come to play
with Jules.</p>

<p>Henry had been looking at the unfinished pictures
with a sort of terror, because they appeared
to him as obstacles between him and his request.
He dared not speak, fearing to hear again the
terrible word "impossible!" and he was going
away, when Jules took him by the hand and
drew him toward Emily. "Sister," he said, "I
have brought my friend Henry to see you; he
wishes to ask you something; do speak to him."</p>

<p>"Jules," she replied, "let me paint; you know
I have very little time. You are playing the
spoiled child: you abuse my indulgence."</p>

<p>"Indeed, Emily, I am not jesting; you must
really speak to Henry. If you knew how unhappy
he is!"</p>

<p>Mademoiselle d'Orbe, raising her eyes to the
boy, was struck with his pale and anxious face,
and said to him in a kind voice, as she continued
her painting: "Forgive my rudeness, my little
friend; this picture is to be sent to the Exposition,
and I have not a moment to lose, because,
both for my brother's sake and my own, I wish
it to do me credit. But speak, my child; speak
without fear, and be assured that I will not refuse
you any thing that is in the power of a poor
artist."</p>

<p>Henry, regaining a little courage, told her
what he desired: then Jules, having related his
friend's visit to their master, Henry added; "But
I see very well, mademoiselle, that you can not
do this portrait either, and I am sorry to have
disturbed you."</p>

<p>In the mean time little Jules had been kissing
his sister, and caressing her soft hair, entreating
her not to refuse his little friend's request.
Mademoiselle d'Orbe was painting Anna Boleyn:
she stopped her work; a struggle seemed to
arise in the depth of her heart, while she looked
affectionately on the children. She, however,
soon laid aside her pallet, and casting one
glance of regret on her picture: "I will take
your father's portrait," she said to Henry&mdash;-"that
man of sorrow and of genius. Your mother's
wish shall be fulfilled."</p>

<p>She had scarcely uttered these words when a
lady entered the room. She was young, pretty,
and richly dressed. Having announced her name,
she asked Mademoiselle d'Orbe to take her portrait,
on the express condition that it should be
finished in time to be placed in the Exposition.</p>

<p>"It is impossible for me to have this honor,
madame," replied the artist: "I have a picture
to finish, and I have just promised to do a portrait
to which I must give all my spare time."
<a class="pagenum" id="page_626" title="pg 626"></a></p>

<p>"You would have been well paid for my portrait,
and my name in the catalogue would have
made yours known," added the young countess.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle d'Orbe only replied by a bow;
and the lady had scarcely withdrawn, when, taking
her bonnet and shawl, the young artist embraced
her brother, took Henry by the hand, and
said to him: "Bring me to your mother, my
child."</p>

<p>Henry flew rather than walked; Mademoiselle
d'Orbe could with difficulty keep up with him.
Both ascended to the fifth story in the house in
the Rue Descartes, where this poor family lived.
When they reached the door, Henry tapped softly
at it. Madame G&mdash;&mdash; opened it.</p>

<p>"Mamma," said the boy, trembling with emotion,
"this lady is an artist: she is come to take
papa's portrait." The poor woman, who had
not hoped for such an unexpected happiness,
wept as she pressed to her lips the hands of
Mademoiselle d'Orbe, and could not find words
to express her gratitude.</p>

<p>The portrait was commenced at once; and
the young artist worked with zeal and devotion,
for her admiration of the gifted and unfortunate
man was intense. She resolved to make the
piece valuable as a work of art, for posterity
might one day demand the portrait of this gifted
man, and her duty as a painter was to represent
him in his noblest aspect.</p>

<p>Long sittings fatigued the invalid; so it was
resolved to take two each day, and the young
artist came regularly twice every day. As by
degrees the strength of the sick man declined,
the portrait advanced. At length, at the end of
twelve days, it was finished: this was about a
week before the death of M. G&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>At the same time that she was painting this
portrait, Mademoiselle d'Orbe worked with ardor
on her large painting, always hoping to have it
ready in time. This hope did not fail her, until
some days before the 1st of February. There
was but a week longer to work: and this year
she must abandon the idea of sending to the
Exposition.</p>

<p>Some artists who had seen her picture had
encouraged her very much; she could count, in
their opinion, on brilliant success. This she desired
with all her heart: first, from that noble
thirst of glory which God has implanted in the
souls of artists; and, secondly, from the influence
it would have on the prospects of her little
Jules, whom she loved with a mother's tenderness,
and whom she wished to be able to endow
with all the treasures of education. This disappointment,
these long hours of toil, rendered so
vain at the very moment when she looked forward
to receive her reward, so depressed the
young artist, that she became dangerously ill.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle d'Orbe had very few friends, as
she was an orphan, and lived in great retirement;
she found herself, therefore, completely left to the
care of her young attendant. When Jules met
Henry at the drawing-school he told him of his
sister's illness: Henry informed his mother, and
Madame G&mdash;&mdash; immediately hastened to Mademoiselle d'Orbe,
whom she found in the delirium
of a fever from which she had been suffering for
some days. The servant said that her mistress
had refused to send for a doctor, pretending that
her illness did not signify. Madame G&mdash;&mdash;, terrified
at the state of her young friend, went out
and soon returned with Dr. Raymond.</p>

<p>The invalid was delirious: she unceasingly repeated
the words&mdash;"portrait," "Anna Boleyn,"
"Exposition," "fortune," "disappointed hopes;"
which plainly indicated the cause of her illness,
and brought tears into the eyes of Madame G&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>"Alas!" she said, "it is on my account she suffers:
I am the cause of her not finishing her picture.
Doctor, I am very unfortunate."</p>

<p>"All may be repaired," replied the doctor; "if
you will promise to nurse the invalid, I will answer
for her recovery."</p>

<p>In fact, Madame G&mdash;&mdash; ever left the sick-bed
of Mademoiselle d'Orbe. The doctor visited her
twice in the day, and their united care soon restored
the health of the interesting artist.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle was scarcely convalescent when
she went to the Exposition of paintings at the
Louvre, of which she had heard nothing&mdash;the
doctor and Madame G&mdash;&mdash; having, as she thought,
avoided touching on a subject which might pain
her. She passed alone through the galleries,
crowded with distinguished artists and elegantly-dressed
ladies, saying to herself that perhaps her
picture would have been as good as many which
attracted the admiration of the crowd. She was
thus walking sadly on, looking at the spot where
she had hoped to have seen her Anna Boleyn,
when she found herself stopped by a group of
artists. They were unanimous in their praises
"This is the best portrait in the Exposition,"
said one. "A celebrated engraver is about to
buy from the artist the right to engrave this portrait
for the new edition of the author's works,"
said another. "We are very fortunate in having
so faithful a likeness of so distinguished a
writer as M. G&mdash;&mdash;."</p>

<p>At this name Mademoiselle d'Orbe raised her
eyes, and recognized her own work! Pale,
trembling with emotion, the young artist was
obliged to lean on the rail for support; then opening
the catalogue, she read her name as if in a
dream, and remained for some time to enjoy the
pleasure of hearing the praises of her genius.</p>

<p>When the Exposition closed she hastened to
Madame G&mdash;&mdash;, and heard that it was Dr. Raymond
who had conceived the happy idea of sending
the portrait to the Louvre. "My only merit
is the separating myself for a time from a picture
which is my greatest consolation," added Madame
G&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>From this day the young artist became the
friend of the poor widow, whose prospects soon
brightened. Through the influence of some of
the friends of her lost husband, she obtained a
pension from government&mdash;a merited but tardy
reward! The two ladies lived near each other,
and spent their evenings together. Henry and
Jules played and studied together. Marie read
aloud, while her mother and Mademoiselle d'Orbe
<a class="pagenum" id="page_627" title="pg 627"></a>
worked. Dr. Raymond sometimes shared in this
pleasant intercourse. He had loved the young
artist from the day he had seen her renounce so
much to do a generous action; but, an orphan
like herself, and with no fortune but his profession,
he feared to be rejected if he offered her his
hand.  It was therefore Madame G&mdash;&mdash; who
charged herself with pleading his suit with the
young artist.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle d'Orbe felt a lively gratitude toward
the young doctor for the care and solicitude
he had shown during her illness, and for sending
her portrait to the Exposition. Thanks to him,
she had become known; commissions arrived in
numbers, a brilliant future opened before her and
Jules. Madame G&mdash;&mdash; had, then, a favorable answer
to give to her young friend, who soon became
the husband of the interesting artist whose
generous sacrifice had been the foundation of her
happiness.</p>

<h2 id="THE_STOLEN_BANK_NOTES">THE STOLEN BANK NOTES.</h2>

<p class="drop">The newspapers of 1810 contain a few brief
paragraphs&mdash;cold, bare, and partial as a
tombstone, relative to a singular, and, to my
thinking, instructive passage in the domestic annals
of Great Britain, with which I happened to
be very intimately acquainted. The impression
it produced on me at the time was vivid and profound,
and a couple of lines in a Liverpool journal
the other day, curtly announcing the death of a
Madame L'Estrange, recalled each incident as
freshly to memory as if graven there but yesterday;
and moreover induced me to pen the following
narrative, in which, now that I can do so
without the risk of giving pain or offense to any
one, I have given the whole affair, divested of
coloring, disguise, or concealment.</p>

<p>My father, who had influence with the late
Lord Bexley, then Mr. Vansittart, procured me,
three weeks after I came of age, a junior clerkship
in one of the best paid of our government
offices. In the same department were two young
men, my seniors by about six or seven years only,
of the names of Martin Travers and Edward Capel.
Their salaries were the same&mdash;three hundred
pounds a year&mdash;and both had an equal chance of
promotion to the vacancy likely soon to occur,
either by the death or superannuation of Mr.
Rowdell, an aged and ailing chief-clerk. I had
known them slightly before I entered the office,
inasmuch as our families visited in the same society,
and we were very soon especially intimate
with each other. They were, I found, fast friends,
though differing greatly in character and temperament.
I liked Martin Travers much the best
of the two. He was a handsome, well-grown,
frank-spoken, generous young man; and never
have I known a person so full of buoyant life as
he&mdash;of a temper so constantly gay and cheerful.
Capel was of a graver, more saturnine disposition,
with lines about the mouth indicative of iron
inflexibility of nerve and will; yet withal a hearty
fellow enough, and living, it was suspected, <i>quite</i>
up to his income, if not to something considerably
over. I had not been more than about three
months in the office, when a marked change was
perceptible in both. Gradually they had become
cold, distant, and at last utterly estranged from
each other; and it was suggested by several
among us, that jealousy as to who should succeed
to Rowdell's snug salary of six hundred a
year, might have produced the evidently bad feeling
between them. This might, I thought, have
generated the lowering cloud hourly darkening
and thickening upon Capel's brow, but could
scarcely account for the change in Martin Travers.
He whose contagious gayety used to render
dullness and ill-humor impossible in his presence,
was now fitful, moody, irascible; his daily
tasks were no longer gone through with the old
cheerful alacrity; and finally&mdash;for he was morbidly
impatient of being questioned&mdash;I jumped to
the conclusion&mdash;partly from some half-words
dropped, and partly from knowing where they
both occasionally visited&mdash;that the subtle influence
which from the days of Helen downward&mdash;and
I suppose upward&mdash;has pleased and plagued
mankind, was at the bottom of the matter. I was
quite right, and proof was not long waited for. I
was walking early one evening along Piccadilly
with Travers&mdash;who appeared, by-the-by, to wish
me further, though he was too polite to say so&mdash;when
we came suddenly upon Capel. I caught
his arm, and insisted that he should take a turn
with us as he used to do. I thought that possibly
a quiet word or two on the beauty and excellence
of kindly brotherhood among men, might lead
to a better feeling between them. I was deucedly
mistaken. My efforts in that line&mdash;awkwardly
enough made, I dare say&mdash;proved utterly abortive.
Capel indeed turned back, rather than, as
I supposed, fussily persist in going on; but both
he and Travers strode on as stiffly as grenadiers
on parade&mdash;their cheeks flushed, their eyes alight
with angry emotion, and altogether sullen and
savage as bears. What seemed odd too, when
Travers turned sharply round within a short distance
of Hyde Park Corner, with a scarcely-disguised
intention of shaking us off, Capel whirled
round as quickly, as if quite as resolutely determined
not to be shaken off; while I, considerably
alarmed by the result of the pacific overture I had
ventured upon, did, of course, the same. We
stalked on in silence, till just as we reached
Hoby's, and a Mr. Hervey, with his daughter
Constance, turned suddenly out of St. James's-street.
I was fiery hot to the tips of my ears in
an instant. Travers and Capel stopped abruptly,
stared fiercely at each other, and barely recovered
presence of mind in sufficient time to lift their
hats in acknowledgment of Mr. Hervey's brief
greeting, and the lady's slight bow, as, after half-pausing,
they passed on. It was all clear enough
now. My two gentlemen had come to Piccadilly
in the hope of meeting with Constance Hervey,
and accompanying her home; frustrated in this,
they had determined not to lose sight of each
other; nor did they for three mortal hours, during
which, anxiety lest their rancorous ill-humor
should break out into open quarrel, kept me
banging about from post to pillar with them&mdash;a
<a class="pagenum" id="page_628" title="pg 628"></a>
sullen companionship, so utterly wearisome that
I had several times half a mind to propose that
they should fight it out at once, or toss up which
should jump for the other's benefit into the
Thames. At length ten o'clock struck, and it
appearing to be mutually concluded that a visit
to Kensington was no longer possible, a sour expression
of relief escaped them, and our very
agreeable party separated.</p>

<p>A very dangerous person in such a crisis was,
I knew, this Constance Hervey, though by no
means a catch in a pecuniary sense for well-connected
young men with present salaries of three
hundred a year, and twice as much in near expectancy.
Her father, who had once held his
head pretty high in the commercial world, had
not long since become bankrupt, and they were
now living upon an annuity of little more, I understood,
than a hundred pounds, so secured to
Mr. Hervey that his creditors could not touch it.
This consideration, however, is one that weighs
very little with men in the condition of mind of
Capel and Travers, and I felt that once enthralled
by Constance Hervey's singular beauty, escape,
or resignation to disappointment was very difficult
and hard to bear. She was no favorite of
mine, just then, by the way. I had first seen her
about three years previously&mdash;and even then,
while yet the light, the simplicity, the candor,
of young girlhood lingered over, and softened
the rising graces of the woman, I read in the
full depths of her dark eyes an exultant consciousness
of beauty, and the secret instinct
of its power. Let me, however, in fairness state
that I had myself&mdash;moon-calf that I must have
been&mdash;made sundry booby, blushing advances to
the youthful beauty, and the half-amused, half-derisive
merriment with which they were received,
gave a twist, no doubt, to my opinion of the
merits of a person so provokingly blind to mine.
Be this, however, as it may, there could be no
question that Constance Hervey was now a very
charming woman, and I was grieved only, not
surprised, at the bitter rivalry that had sprung up
between Travers and Capel&mdash;a rivalry which each
successive day but fed and strengthened!</p>

<p>Capel appeared to be fast losing all control
over his temper and mode of life. He drank
freely&mdash;that was quite clear; gambled, it was
said, and rumors of debt, protested bills, ready
money raised at exorbitant interest on the faith
of his succeeding to Rowdell's post, flew thick
as hail about the office. Should he obtain the
coveted six hundred a year, Constance Hervey
would, I doubted not&mdash;first favorite as Travers
now seemed to be&mdash;condescend to be Mrs. Capel.
This, not very complimentary opinion, I had been
mentally repeating some dozen times with more
than ordinary bitterness as I sat alone one evening
after dinner in our little dining-room in Golden-square,
when the decision came. The governor
being out, I had perhaps taken a few extra
glasses of wine, and nothing, in my experience,
so lights up and inflames tender or exasperating
reminiscences as fine old port.</p>

<p>"Rat-tat-tat-tat." It was unmistakably Travers's
knock, and boisterously hilarious, too, as
in the old time, before any Constance Herveys
had emerged from pinafores and tuckers to distract
and torment mankind, and more especially
well-to-do government clerks. The startled maid-servant
hastened to the door, and I had barely
gained my feet and stretched myself, when in
bounced Travers&mdash;radiant&mdash;a-blaze with triumph.</p>

<p>"Hollo, Travers! Why, where the deuce do
you spring from, eh?"</p>

<p>"From Heaven! Paradise!&mdash;the presence of
an angel at all events!"</p>

<p>"There, there, that will do; I quite understand."</p>

<p>"No, you don't Ned. Nobody but myself <i>can</i>
understand, imagine, guess, dream of the extent
the vastness of the change that has come over
my life. Firstly, then&mdash;but this is nothing&mdash;Rowdell
is at length superannuated, and I am to
have his place."</p>

<p>He paused a moment; and I, with certainly a
more than half-envious sneer, said&mdash;"And upon
the strength of that piece of luck, you have proposed
to Constance Hervey, and been accepted&mdash;of
course."</p>

<p>"<i>Jubilate</i>&mdash;yes! Feel how my pulse throbs!
It is four hours since, and still my brain lightens
and my eyes dazzle with the tumultuous joy.
Do not light the candles; I shall grow calmer in
the twilight."</p>

<p>"Confound his raptures," was my internal
ejaculation. "Why the mischief couldn't he
take them somewhere else?" I, however, said
nothing, and he presently resumed the grateful
theme. "You will be at the wedding, of course.
And by-the-by, now I think of it, haven't I heard
Constance say she especially remembers you for
something&mdash;I forget exactly what&mdash;but something
pleasant and amusing&mdash;very!"</p>

<p>My face kindled to flame, and I savagely whirled
the easy chair in which I sat two or three
yards back from the fire-light before speaking.
"I am extremely obliged to the lady, and so I
dare say is poor Capel, who, it seems, has been
so carelessly thrown over."</p>

<p>"Carelessly thrown over!" rejoined Travers,
sharply. "That is a very improper expression.
If he has, as I fear, indulged in illusions, he has
been only self-deceived. Still, his double disappointment
grieves me. It seems to cast&mdash;though
there is no valid reason that it should do so&mdash;a
shadow on my conscience."</p>

<p>We were both silent for some time. I was in
no mood for talking, and he sat gazing dreamily
at the fire. I knew very well whose face he saw
there. I have seen it myself in the same place
a hundred times.</p>

<p>"There is another drawback, Ned," he at
length resumed. "Our marriage must be deferred
six months at the least. I have but about
two hundred pounds in ready money, and the
lease and furniture of the house we shall require,
would cost at least double that."</p>

<p>"Any respectable establishment would credit
you for the furniture upon the strength of your
greatly-increased salary."
<a class="pagenum" id="page_629" title="pg 629"></a></p>

<p>"So I urged; but Constance has such a perfect
horror of debt&mdash;arising no doubt from her
father's misfortunes&mdash;that she positively insists
we must wait till every thing required in our new
establishment can be paid for when purchased.
I could, I think, raise the money upon my own
acceptance, but should Constance hear that I
had done so, she would, I fear, withdraw her
promise."</p>

<p>"Stuff and nonsense! Six hundred a year
can not be picked up every day."</p>

<p>"You do not know Constance Hervey. But
come; I must have patience! Six&mdash;nine months
are not a lifetime. Good-by. I knew you would
be rejoiced to hear of my good fortune."</p>

<p>"Oh, of course&mdash;particularly delighted, in fact!
Good-evening." I have slept better than I did
that night.</p>

<p>It was Sunday evening when Travers called
on me, and Capel did not make his appearance
at the office till the Friday following, his excuse
being urgent private business. Harassing business,
if that were so, it must have been, for a
sharp fever could scarcely have produced a greater
change for the worse in his personal appearance.
He was mentally changed as greatly. He very
heartily congratulated Travers on his promotion,
and took, moreover, the first opportunity of privately
assuring him that his (Capel's) transient
fancy for Miss Hervey had entirely passed away,
and he cordially complimented his former rival
on having succeeded in that quarter also. This
was all remarkably queer, <i>I</i> thought; but Travers,
from whose mind a great load seemed taken,
willingly believed him, and they were better
friends than ever; Capel, the more thoroughly,
it seemed, to mark his acquiescent indifference,
accompanying Travers once or twice to the Herveys'.
So did I; though I would have given
something the first time to have been any where
else; for if a certain kneeling down, garden-arbor
scene did not play about the lady's coral
lips, and gleam for a moment from the corners
of her bewildering eyes, my pulse was as steady
and temperate just then, as it is now, after the
frosts of more than sixty winters have chilled its
beatings. She was, however, very kind and
courteous, a shade <i>too</i> considerately gentle and
patronizing, perhaps, and I became a rather frequent
visitor. An ancient aunt, and very worthy
soul, lived with them, with whom I now and then
took a turn at backgammon, while the affianced
couple amused themselves with chess&mdash;such
chess! Travers was, I knew, a superior player,
but on these occasions he hardly appeared to
know a queen from a rook, or a bishop from a
pawn. They were thus absurdly engaged one
evening, when I made a discovery which, if it
did not much surprise, greatly pained and somewhat
alarmed me. Aunt Jane had left the room
on some household intent, and I, partly concealed
in the recess where I sat, by the window-curtain,
silently contemplated the queer chess-playing,
the entranced delight of the lover, and the calm,
smiling graciousness of the lady. I have felt in
a more enviable frame of mind&mdash;more composed,
more comfortable than I did just then, but, good
lord! what was my innocent little pit-pat compared
with the storm of hate, and fury, and despair,
which found terrific expression in the
countenance that, as attracted by a slight noise,
I hastily looked up, met my view! It was Capel's.
He had entered the room, the door being
ajar, unobserved, and was gazing, as he supposed,
unmarked, at the chess-players. I was
so startled that I, mechanically, as it were, sprang
to my feet, and as I did so, Capel's features, by a
strong effort of will, resumed their ordinary expression,
save for the deathly pallor that remained,
and a nervous quivering of the upper lip which
could not be instantly mastered. I was more than
satisfied as to the true nature of smooth-seeming
Mr. Capel's sentiments toward the contracted
couple, but as <i>they</i> had observed nothing, I thought
it wisest to hold my peace. I could not, however,
help smiling at the confiding simplicity with
which Travers, as we all three walked homeward
together, sought counsel of Capel as to the readiest
means of raising&mdash;unknown to Miss Hervey&mdash;the
funds necessary to be obtained before Prudence,
as interpreted by that lady, would permit
his marriage. Slight help, thought I, for such
a purpose, will be afforded by the owner of the
amiable countenance I saw just now.</p>

<p>It was just a week after this that thunder fell
upon our office by the discovery that sixteen
hundred pounds in Bank of England notes, sent
in by different parties, late on the previous day,
had disappeared, together with a memorandum-book
containing the numbers and dates. Great,
it may be imagined, was the consternation among
us all, and a rigorous investigation, which, however,
led to nothing, was immediately instituted.
Capel, who showed extraordinary zeal in the
matter, went, accompanied by one of the chief
clerks, to the parties from whom the notes had
been received, for fresh lists, in order that payment
might be stopped. On their return, it was
given out that no accurate, reliable list could be
obtained. This, it was afterward found, was a
<i>ruse</i> adopted in order to induce the thief or
thieves to more readily attempt getting the notes
into circulation.</p>

<p>This occurred in the beginning of September,
and about the middle of October, Travers suddenly
informed me that he was to be married on
the following Monday&mdash;this was Tuesday. The
lease of a house at Hammersmith had, he said,
been agreed for, the furniture ordered, and every
thing was to be completed and paid for by the
end of the present week. "And the money&mdash;the
extra two hundred and odd pounds required&mdash;how
has that been obtained?" "Of my uncle
Woolridge, a marriage-<i>gift</i>, though he won't, I
believe, be present at the wedding," returned the
bridegroom-elect, with a joyous chuckle. I was
quite sure from his manner, as well as from my
knowledge of his uncle's penurious character,
that this was a deception. Constance Hervey's
scruples, I had always thought, now that it was
certain his next quarter's salary would be one
hundred and fifty pounds were somewhat over
<a class="pagenum" id="page_630" title="pg 630"></a>
strained and unreasonable&mdash;still I was vexed
that he had stooped to deceive her by such a
subterfuge. It was, however, no especial affair
of mine, and I reluctantly accepted his invitation
to dine at the Herveys' with him on the last day
of his bachelorhood, that is, on the following
Sunday. Capel was invited, but he refused. I
also, declined, and resolutely, to attend the wedding.
That would, I felt, be <i>un peu trop fort</i>
just then.</p>

<p>A very pleasant party assembled at Mr. Hervey's
on the afternoon of that terrible Sunday,
and we were cheerfully chatting over the dessert,
when the servant-girl announced that four
gentlemen were at the door who said they <i>must</i>
see Mr. Travers instantly.</p>

<p>"<i>Must</i> see me!" exclaimed Travers. "Very
peremptory, upon my word. With your leave,
sir&mdash;and yours, Constance, I will see these very
determined gentlemen here. Bid them walk in,
Susan."</p>

<p>Before Susan could do so, the door opened,
and in walked the strangers <i>without</i> invitation.
One of them, a square, thick-set, bullet-headed
man it instantly struck me I had been in company
with before. Oh! to be sure! he was the
officer who conducted the investigation in the
matter of the stolen notes. What on earth could
<i>he</i> want there&mdash;or with Travers?</p>

<p>"You paid, Mr. Travers," said he, bluntly,
"something over four hundred pounds to these
two gentlemen, yesterday."</p>

<p>"Yes, certainly I did; no doubt about it."</p>

<p>"Will you tell us, then, if you please, where
you obtained the notes in which you made those
payments?"</p>

<p>"Obtained them&mdash;where I obtained them?"
said Travers, who did not, I think, immediately
recognize the officer. "To be sure. Four of
them&mdash;four fifties&mdash;I have had by me for some
time; and&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The two one-hundred pound notes&mdash;how
about them?" quietly suggested the man, seeing
Travers hesitate.</p>

<p>Travers, more confused than alarmed, perhaps,
but white as the paper on which I am writing,
glanced hurriedly round&mdash;we had all impulsively
risen to our feet&mdash;till his eye rested upon Constance
Hervey's eagerly-attentive countenance.
"I received them," he stammered, repeating, I
was sure, a falsehood, "from my uncle, Mr.
Woolridge, of Tottenham."</p>

<p>"Then, of course, you will have no objection
to accompany us to your uncle, Mr. Woolridge,
of Tottenham?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not; but not now. To-morrow&mdash;you
see I am engaged now."</p>

<p>"I am sorry to say, Mr. Travers, that you
<i>must</i> go with us. Those two notes were among
those stolen from the office to which you belong."</p>

<p>There was a half-stifled scream&mdash;a broken sob,
and, but for me, Constance Hervey would have
fallen senseless on the floor. Travers was in
the merciless grasp of the officers, who needlessly
hurried him off, spite of his frantic entreaties
for a brief delay. The confusion and
terror of such a scene may be imagined, not described.
Although at first somewhat staggered,
five minutes had not passed before I felt thoroughly
satisfied that Travers was the victim of some
diabolical plot; and I pretty well guessed of
whose concoction. An untruth he had no doubt
been guilty of, through fear of displeasing his
betrothed&mdash;but guilty of stealing money&mdash;of
plundering the office!&mdash;bah!&mdash;the bare supposition
was an absurdity.</p>

<p>As soon as Miss Hervey was sufficiently recovered
to listen, I endeavored to reason with
her in this sense, but she could not sufficiently
command her attention. "My brain is dizzy and
confused as yet," she said; "do you follow, and
ascertain, as far as possible, <i>all</i> the truth&mdash;the
worst truth. I shall be calmer when you return."</p>

<p>"I did so, and in less than two hours I was
again at Kensington. Travers was locked up,
after confessing that his statement of having received
the hundred-pound notes of his uncle
Woolridge, was untrue. He would probably be
examined at Bow-street the next day&mdash;his wedding-day,
as he had fondly dreamed!"</p>

<p>I found Constance Hervey&mdash;unlike her father
and aunt, who were moaning and lamenting
about the place like distracted creatures&mdash;perfectly
calm and self-possessed, though pale as
Parian marble. I told her all&mdash;all I had heard
and seen, and all that I suspected. Her eyes
kindled to intensest lustre as I spoke. "I have
no doubt," she said, "that your suspicions point
the right way, but proof, confronted as we shall
be by that wretched falsehood, will, I fear, be
difficult. But I will not despair; the truth will,
I trust, ultimately prevail. And remember,
Thornton," she added, "that we count entirely
upon you." She gave me her hand on saying
this; I clutched it with ridiculous enthusiasm,
and blurted out&mdash;as if I had been a warlike
knight instead of a peaceable clerk&mdash;"You may,
Miss Hervey, to the death!" In fact, at that
particular moment, although by no means naturally
pugnacious, and, moreover, of a somewhat
delicate constitution, I think I should have proved
an ugly customer had there been any body in the
way to fight with. This, however, not being the
case, I consulted with Mr. Hervey as to what
legal assistance ought to be secured, and it was
finally determined that I should request Mr. Elkins,
a solicitor residing in Lothbury, to take
Travers's instructions, and that Mr. Alley, the
barrister, should be retained to attend at Bow-street.
This matter settled, I took my leave.</p>

<p>I had a very unsatisfactory account to render
on the morrow evening to the anxious family at
Kensington. Travers's appearance at Bow-street
had been deferred, at the request of his solicitor,
to Wednesday, in order that the individual from
whom the prisoner <i>
ow</i> declared he had received
the stolen notes might be communicated with.
The explanation given by Travers to the solicitor
was briefly this: About seven months previously
he had amassed a considerable sum in guineas&mdash;then
<a class="pagenum" id="page_631" title="pg 631"></a>
bearing a high premium, although it was
an offense at law to dispose of them for more in
silver or notes than their nominal value. Somebody&mdash;Mr.
Capel, he was pretty sure, but would
not be positive&mdash;mentioned to him the name of
one Louis Brocard, of No. 18 Brewer-street, as
a man who would be likely to give him a good
price for his gold. Travers accordingly saw Brocard,
who, after considerable haggling, paid him
two hundred pounds in Bank of England notes&mdash;four
fifties&mdash;for one hundred and sixty-two
guineas. That lately he, Travers, had often
mentioned to Capel, that he wished to raise, as
secretly as possible, on his own personal security,
a sum of at least two hundred pounds, and that
Capel&mdash;this he was sure of, as not more than a
month had since elapsed&mdash;Capel had advised him
to apply to Louis Brocard for assistance. He had
done so, and Brocard had given him the two
one-hundred pound notes in exchange for a note
of hand, at six months' date, for two hundred
and twenty pounds. I had obtained temporary
leave of absence from the office, and at the solicitor's
request I accompanied him to Brewer-street.
Brocard&mdash;a strong-featured, swarthy
<i>emigr&eacute;</i> from the south of France, Languedoc, I
believe, who had been in this country since '92,
and spoke English fluently&mdash;was at home, and I
could not help thinking, from his manner, expecting
and prepared for some such visit. There
was a young woman with him, his niece, he said,
Marie Deschamps, of the same cast of features
as himself, but much handsomer, and with dark
fiery eyes, that upon the least excitement seemed
to burn like lightning. Brocard confirmed Travers's
statement without hesitation as to the purchase
of the gold and the discount of the bill.
"In what money did you pay the two hundred
pounds for which you received the acceptance?"
asked the solicitor.</p>

<p>"I will tell you," replied Brocard, coolly.
"Marie, give me the pocket-book from the desk&mdash;the
red one. September 26th," he continued,
after adjusting his spectacles, "Martin Travers,
four fifty Bank of England notes," and he read
off the dates and numbers, of which I possess no
memoranda.</p>

<p>"Why, those are the notes," exclaimed Mr.
Elkins, very much startled, and glancing at a
list in his hand, "which you paid Mr. Travers
for the gold, and which you and others I could
name, knew he had not since parted with!"</p>

<p>A slight flush crossed the Frenchman's brow,
and the niece's eyes gleamed with fierce expression
at these words. The emotion thus displayed
was but momentary.</p>

<p>"You are misinformed," said Brocard. "Here
is a memorandum made at the time (March 3d)
of the notes paid for the gold. You can read it
yourself. The largest in amount, you will see,
was a twenty."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to persist in asserting," said
Mr. Elkins, after several moments of dead silence,
"that you did not pay Mr. Travers for
his bill of exchange in two one-hundred pound
notes?"</p>

<p>"Persist!" exclaimed the Frenchman. "I
don't understand your 'persist!' I have told
you the plain truth. Persist&mdash;<i>parbleu</i>!"</p>

<p>I was dumfoundered. "Pray, Monsieur Brocard,"
said the solicitor, suddenly; "Do you
know Mr. Capel?"</p>

<p>The swarthy flush was plainer now, and not
so transitory. "Capel&mdash;Capel," he muttered,
averting his face toward his niece. "Do we
know Capel, Marie?"</p>

<p>"No doubt your niece does, Mr. Brocard,"
said the solicitor, with a sharp sneer, "or that
eloquent face of hers belies her."</p>

<p>In truth, Marie Deschamps's features were
a-flame with confused and angry consciousness;
and her brilliant eyes sparkled with quick ire, as
she retorted, "And if I do, what then?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, <i>perhaps</i>, young lady; but my question
was addressed to your uncle."</p>

<p>"I have nothing more to say," rejoined Brocard.
"I know nothing of the hundred pound
notes; very little of Mr. Capel, whom now, however,
I remember. And pray, sir," he added,
with a cold, malignant smile, "did I not hear
this morning, that Martin Travers informed the
officers that it was a relation, an uncle, I believe,
from whom he received the said notes&mdash;stolen
notes, it seems? He will endeavor to inculpate
some one else by-and-by, I dare say."</p>

<p>There was no parrying this thrust, and we
came away, much disturbed and discouraged. I
remained late that evening at Kensington, talking
the unfortunate matter over; but hope, alas!
of a safe deliverance for poor Travers appeared
impossible, should Brocard persist in his statement.
The prisoner's lodgings had been minutely
searched, but no trace of the still missing
fourteen hundred pounds had been discovered
there. Constance Hervey appeared to be greatly
struck with my account of Marie Deschamps's
appearance and demeanor, and made me repeat
each circumstance over and over again. I could
not comprehend how this could so much interest
her at such a time.</p>

<p>Brocard repeated his statement, on oath, at
Bow-street, and Mr. Alley's cross-examination
failed to shake his testimony. The first declaration
made by Travers necessarily deprived his
after protestations, vehement as they were, of all
respect; but I could not help feeling surprise
that the barrister's suggestion that it was absurd
to suppose that a man in possession of the very
large sum that had been stolen, would have <i>borrowed</i>
two hundred pounds at an exorbitant interest,
was treated with contempt. All that, it
was hinted, was a mere colorable contrivance to
be used in case of detection. The prisoner feared
to put too many of the notes in circulation at
once, and the acceptance would have been paid
for in the stolen moneys, and so on. Finally,
Travers was committed for trial, and bail was
refused.</p>

<p>As the star of the unfortunate Travers sank
in disastrous eclipse, that of Capel shone more
brilliantly. There was no doubt that he would
succeed, on his rival's conviction, to the vacated
<a class="pagenum" id="page_632" title="pg 632"></a>
post; and some eight or nine weeks after Travers
had been committed, circumstances occurred
which induced me to believe that he would be
equally successful in another respect. I must
also say that Capel evinced from the first much
sorrow for his old friend's lamentable fall; he
treated the notion of his being guiltless with disdain,
and taking me one day aside, he said he
should endeavor to get Brocard out of the country
before the day of trial either by fair means
or by tipping him the Alien Act. "In fact," he
added, with some confusion of manner, "I have
faithfully promised Miss Hervey, that for <i>her</i>
sake, though she can have no more doubt of his
guilt than I have, that no effort shall be spared
to prevent his <i>legal</i> conviction; albeit, life, without
character will be, I should think, no great
boon to him."</p>

<p>"For <i>her</i> sake! You, Edward Capel, have
faithfully promised Miss Hervey to attempt this
for <i>her</i> sake!" I exclaimed, as soon as I could
speak for sheer astonishment.</p>

<p>"Ay, truly: does that surprise you, Thornton?"
he added, with a half-bitter, half-Malvolio
smile.</p>

<p>"Supremely; and if it be as your manner intimates,
why then, Frailty, thy name in very
truth is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Woman!" broke in Capel, taking the word
out of my mouth. "No doubt of it, from the
days of Eve till ours. But come, let us return
to business."</p>

<p>I had been for some time grievously perplexed
by the behavior of Constance Hervey. Whenever
I had called at Kensington, I found, that
though at times she appeared to be on the point
of breaking through a self-imposed restraint, all
mention of Travers, as far as possible, was avoided,
and that some new object engrossed the mind
of Constance, to the exclusion of every other.
What a light did this revelation of Capel's throw
on her conduct and its motives! And it was
such a woman as that, was it, that I had enshrined
in the inmost recesses of my heart, and
worshiped as almost a divinity! Great God!</p>

<p>These thoughts were trembling on my lips,
when a brief note was brought me: "Miss Hervey's
compliments to Mr. Edward Thornton, and
she will be obliged if, late as it is, he will hasten
to Kensington immediately." I had never seen
a line of hers before in my life, and it was wonderful
how all my anger, suspicion, scorn, vanished&mdash;exhaled,
before those little fly-stroke characters;
so much so that&mdash;but no, I won't expose
myself. A hack soon conveyed me to Kensington;
Mr. Hervey, Constance, and good Aunt
Jane were all there in the parlor, evidently in
expectation of my arrival. Miss Hervey proceeded
to business at once.</p>

<p>"You have not seen Marie Deschamps lately,
I believe?"</p>

<p>"Not I! The last time I saw her was in
Bow-street, whither she accompanied her scoundrel
of an uncle."</p>

<p>"Well, you must see her again to-morrow.
She is deeply attached to Mr. Capel, and expects
that he will marry her as soon as Martin Travers
is convicted; and he, Capel, has secured the
vacant place."</p>

<p>"Ha!"</p>

<p>"Mr. Capel," continued Miss Hervey, and a
glint of sparkling sunlight shot from her charming
eyes, "has been foolish enough to prefer
another person&mdash;at least so I am instructed by
papa, with whom the gentleman left this note,
not yet opened, addressed to me, some three
hours since. I can imagine its contents, but let
us see."</p>

<p>I can not depict in words the scorn, contempt,
pride&mdash;triumph, too&mdash;that swept over that beautiful
countenance. "Very impassioned and eloquent,
upon my word," she said; "I only wonder
such burning words did not fire the paper. Now,
Mr. Thornton, you must see this forsaken damsel,
Marie Deschamps, and acquaint her with
Mr. Capel's inconstancy. She will require
proof&mdash;it shall be afforded her. In answer to
this missive, I shall appoint Mr. Capel to see me
here to-morrow evening at seven o'clock. Do
you bring her by half-past six, and place yourselves
in yon little ante-room, where every thing
done here, and every word spoken, can be distinctly
seen and heard. This well managed, I
am greatly deceived in those southern eyes of
hers if the iniquitous plot, of which there can be
no doubt she holds the clew, will not receive an
unlooked-for solution."</p>

<p>"Charming! glorious! beautiful!" I was
breaking into <i>&eacute;clats</i> of enthusiastic admiration,
but Miss Hervey, who was too earnest and excited
to listen patiently to rhapsodies, cut me
short with, "My dear sir, it's getting very late,
and there is, you know, much to be done to-morrow."
It's not pleasant to be let down so suddenly
when you are so particularly stilty, but as
I was by this time pretty well used to it, I submitted
with the best possible grace, and, after
receiving some other explanations and directions,
took leave.</p>

<p>I obtained an interview without difficulty, on
the following morning, with Marie Deschamps,
just before office hours, and in her uncle's absence.
She was curious to know the object of
my visit; but her manner, though free and gay,
was carefully guarded and unrelenting, till I
gradually and cautiously introduced the subject
of Capel's infidelity. It was marvelous how, as
each sentence fell upon her ear, her figure stiffened
into statue-like rigidity, and her eyes kindled
with fiery passion. "If this be so," she
said, when I ceased speaking, "he is playing
with his life! Is she the lady I passed a fortnight
since, when with him in the Park?"
"Describe the lady, and I will tell you." She
did so; it was the exact portrait of Miss Hervey,
and so I told her. "I had a misgiving at
the time," she said; "if it prove true&mdash;but I
will believe, after what has passed, only my own
eyes and ears."</p>

<p>This was all we desired; a satisfactory arrangement
was agreed upon, and I left her, not
without hugging self-gratulation that <i>I</i> was not
<a class="pagenum" id="page_633" title="pg 633"></a>
the recreant sweetheart about to be caught <i>in
flagrante delicto</i> by such a damsel.</p>

<p>I watched Capel that day with keen attention.
He was much excited it was evident, and withal
ill at ease: there was a nervous apprehensiveness
in his manner and aspect I had never before noticed,
over which, however, from time to time
quick flashes of exultation glimmered, sparkled,
and then vanished. Is it, thought I, the shadow
of a sinister catastrophe that already projects
over and awes, appalls him? It might be.</p>

<p>Marie Deschamps and I were ensconced punctually
at the hour named, in the little slip of
a closet communicating with the Herveys' up-stairs
sitting-room. Nobody appeared there till
about five minutes to seven, when Constance,
charmingly attired, and looking divinely&mdash;though
much agitated, I could see through all her assumed
firmness&mdash;entered, and seated herself
upon a small couch, directly in front of the tiny
window through which we cautiously peered.
"No wonder," I mentally exclaimed, "that Capel
has been beguiled of all sense or discretion!"</p>

<p>In reply to Marie Deschamps' look of jealous
yet admiring surprise, I whispered, pointing to
the neat but poor furniture, "Capel expects, you
know, soon to have six hundred a year." "Ah,"
she rejoined, in the same tone, "and in this country
gold is God!" "And all the Saints in yours,
I believe; but hark! there is a knock at the
door; it is he, no doubt."</p>

<p>Comparatively dark as the closet was, I could
see the red, swarthy color come and go on the
young woman's cheeks and forehead; and I fancied
I could hear the violent and hurried beating
of her heart. Presently Mr. Capel entered the
apartment; his features were flushed as with
fever, and his whole manner exhibited uncontrollable
agitation. His first words were unintelligible,
albeit their purport might be guessed.
Miss Hervey, though much disturbed also, managed
to say, after a few moment's awkward
silence, and with a half-ironical yet fascinating
smile, taking up as she spoke a letter which lay
upon the table, "Upon my word, Mr. Capel,
this abrupt proposal of yours appears to me, under
the circumstances, to be singularly ill-timed
and premature, besides&mdash;"</p>

<p>The lady's discomposure had, it struck me,
dissipated a half-formed suspicion in Capel's
mind that some trap or mystification was preparing
for him, and, throwing himself at the feet
of Constance, he gave way to a torrent of fervent,
headlong protestation, which there could be no
question was the utterance of genuine passion.
Marie Deschamps felt this, and but that I forcibly
held her back, she would have burst into the
room at once: as it was she pressed her arms
across her bosom with her utmost force, as if to
compress, keep down, the wild rage by which
she was, I saw, shaken and convulsed. Miss
Hervey appeared affected by Capel's vehemence,
and she insisted that he should rise and seat
himself. He did so, and after a minute or so
of silence, Constance again resolutely addressed
herself to the task she had determined to perform.</p>

<p>"But the lady, Mr. Capel, whom we saw you
conversing with not long since in the Park;
one Marie&mdash;Marie, something?"</p>

<p>"The name of such a person as Marie Deschamps
should not sully Miss Hervey's lips, even
in jest, ha!&mdash;"</p>

<p>
o wonder he stopped abruptly, and turned
round with quick alarm. Till that moment I had
with difficulty succeeded in holding the said Marie,
but no sooner was her name thus contemptuously
pronounced, than she plucked a small, glittering
instrument from her bodice&mdash;the half of a pair
of scissors, it seemed to me, but pointed and
sharp as a dagger&mdash;and drove it into my arm with
such hearty good-will, that I loosed her in a
twinkling. In she burst upon the utterly astounded
Capel with a cry of rage and vengeance, and
struck furiously at him right and left, at the same
time hurling in his face the epithets of "liar!"
"traitor!" "robber!" "villain!" and so on, as
thick as hail, and with maniacal fury. I had instantly
followed, and at the same moment Mr.
Hervey, and the officer who arrested Travers,
came in by another door. I and Mr. Hervey
placed ourselves before Constance, who was
terribly scared, for this stabbing business was
more than we had looked or bargained for. The
officer seized Marie Deschamps' arm, and with
some difficulty wrenched the dangerous weapon
she wielded with such deadly ferocity from her
grasp. It was, as I supposed, a sharpened scissors-blade,
and keen, as a large scar on my arm
still testifies, as a poinard. Capel, paralyzed,
bewildered by so unexpected and furious an attack,
and bleeding in several places, though not
seriously hurt, staggered back to the wall, against
which he supported himself, as he gazed with
haggard fear and astonishment at the menacing
scene before him.</p>

<p>"And so you would marry that lady, thief and
villain that you are!" continued the relentless
young fury; "she shall know, then, what you
are; that it was you contrived the stealing of
the bank notes, which&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Marie!" shrieked Capel, "dear Marie! for
your own sake, stop! I will do any thing&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dog! traitor!" she broke in, with even yet
wilder passion than before, if it were possible;
"it is too late. I know you now, and spit at
both you and your promises? It was you, I say,
who brought my uncle the one-hundred pound
notes by which your <i>friend</i>, Martin Travers, has
been entrapped!"</p>

<p>"'Tis false! the passionate, mad, jealous fool
lies!" shouted Capel, with frantic terror.</p>

<p>"Lie, do I? Then there is <i>
ot</i> a thousand
pounds worth of the stolen notes concealed at this
moment beneath the floor of your sitting-room,
till an opportunity can be found of sending them
abroad! That, unmatched villain that you are,
is false, too, perhaps?"</p>

<p>She paused from sheer exhaustion, and for a
brief space no one spoke, so suddenly had the
blow fallen. Presently the officer said, "The
<a class="pagenum" id="page_634" title="pg 634"></a>
game is up, you see, at last, Mr. Capel; you
will go with me;" and he stepped toward the
unhappy culprit. Capel, thoroughly desperate,
turned, sprang with surprising agility over a
dining-table, threw up a window-sash, and leapt
into the street. The height was not so much,
but his feet caught in some iron railing, and he
fell head foremost on the pavement, fracturing
his skull frightfully. Before an hour had passed,
he was dead.</p>

<p>Brocard contrived to escape, but the evidence
of Marie Deschamps and the finding of the stolen
notes, in accordance with her statement, fully
established the innocence of Travers, and he
was restored to freedom and his former position
in the world. He and Constance Hervey, to
whom he owed so much, were married three
months after his liberation, and I officiated, by
particular desire, as bride's father.</p>

<p>I had lost sight of Marie Deschamps for some
twelve or thirteen years, when I accidentally met
her in Liverpool. She was a widow, having
married and buried a M. L'Estrange, a well-to-do
person there, who left her in decent circumstances.
We spoke together of the events I
have briefly but faithfully narrated, and she expressed
much contrition for the share she had
taken in the conspiracy against Travers. I fancied,
too&mdash;it was perhaps an unjust fancy&mdash;that,
knowing I had lately been promoted to four
hundred a year, she wished to dazzle me with
those still bright eyes of hers&mdash;a bootless effort,
by whomsoever attempted. The talismanic image
daguerreotyped upon my heart in the bright
sunlight of young manhood, could have no rival
there, and is even now as fresh and radiant as
when first impressed, albeit the strong years have
done their work, yet very gently, upon the original.
It could scarcely be otherwise, living visibly,
as she still does, in youthful grace and beauty in
the person of the gay gipsy I am, please God, soon
to "give away," at St. Pancras Church, as I did
her grandmamma, more than forty years ago, at
Kensington. Constance, <i>this</i> Constance is, as
she well knows, to be my heiress. Travers, her
grandfather, is now a silver-haired, yet hale,
jocund, old man; and so tenderly, I repeat, has
Time dealt with his wife&mdash;the Constance Hervey
of this narrative&mdash;that I can sometimes hardly believe
her to be more than about three or four and
forty years of age. This is, however, perhaps
only an illusion of the long and, whatever fools
or skeptics may think, or say, elevating dream
that has pursued me through youth and middle
age, even unto confirmed old bachelorhood. Madame
L'Estrange, as before stated, died a short
time since at Liverpool; her death, by influenza,
the paper noticed, was sudden and unexpected.</p>

<h2 id="WONDERFUL_TOYS">WONDERFUL TOYS.</h2>

<p class="drop">Very wonderful things are told by various
writers of the power of inventive genius in
expending itself upon trifles. Philip Camuz
describes an extraordinary automaton group that
was got up, regardless, of course, of expense,
for the entertainment of Louis the Fourteenth.
It consisted of a coach and horses&mdash;what a
modern coachman would designate "a first-rate
turn-out." Its road was a table; and, at starting,
the coachman smacked his whip, the horses
began to prance; then, subsiding into a long
trot, they continued until the whole equipage
arrived opposite to where the King sat. They
then stopped, a footman dismounted from the
foot-board, opened the door, and handed out a
lady; who, courtesying gracefully, offered a petition
to his Majesty, and re-entered the carriage.
The footman jumped up behind&mdash;all right&mdash;the
whip smacked once more; the horses pranced,
and the long trot was resumed.</p>

<p>Some of the stories extant, respecting musical
automata, are no less extraordinary. D'Alembert
gives an account, in the "<i>Encyclop&eacute;die Methodique</i>,"
of a gigantic mechanical Flute-player. It
stood on a pedestal, in which some of the
"works" were contained; and, not only blew
into the flute, but, with its lips, increased or
diminished the tones it forced out of the instrument,
performing the legato and staccato passages
to perfection. The fingering was also
quite accurate. This marvelous Flautist was
exhibited in Paris in 1738, and was made by
Jacques de Vaucanson, the prince of automaton
contrivers.</p>

<p>Vaucanson labored under many disadvantages
in constructing this marvelous figure; among
others, that of a skeptic uncle; who, for some
years, laughed him out of his project. At length,
fortune favored the mechanist with a severe illness;
and he took advantage of it to contrive
the automaton he had so long dreamt of. This
was at Grenoble; and, as Vaucanson designed
each portion of the figure, he sent it to be made
by a separate workman; that no one should find
out the principle of his invention. As the pieces
came home, he put them together; and, when
the whole was completed, he crawled out of bed,
by the help of a servant who had been his go-between
with the various operative mechanics,
and locked his chamber door. Trembling with
anxiety, he wound up the works. At the first
sound emitted from the flute, the servant fell on
his knees, and began to worship his master as
somebody more than mortal. They both embraced
each other, and wept with joy to the tune
which the figure was merrily playing.</p>

<p>
one of Vaucanson's imitators have been able
to accomplish the organization by which his
figure modified the tones, by the action of the
lips; although several flute-playing puppets have
since been made. About forty years ago there
was an exhibition in London, of two mechanical
figures, of the size of life, which performed duets.
Incredulous visitors were in the habit of placing
their fingers on the holes of the flutes, in order
to convince themselves that the puppets really
supplied the wind, which caused the flutes to
discourse such excellent music.</p>

<p>A full orchestra of clock-work musicians is
quite possible. Maelzel, the inventor of the
Metronome, opened an exhibition in Vienna, in
1809, in which an automaton Trumpeter as large
<a class="pagenum" id="page_635" title="pg 635"></a>
as life, performed with surprising accuracy and
power. The audience first saw, on entering the
room, a tent. Presently the curtains opened,
and Maelzel appeared leading forward the trumpeter,
attired in full regimentals of an Austrian
dragoon. He then pressed the left epaulet of
the figure, and it began to sound, not only all the
cavalry flails then in use for directing the evolutions
of the Austrian cavalry, but to play a march,
and an allegro by Weigl, which was accompanied
by a full band of living musicians. The figure
then retired; and, in a few minutes, reappeared
in the dress of a trumpeter of the French guard.
The inventor wound it up on the left hip; another
touch on the left shoulder, and forth came
from the trumpet, in succession, all the French
cavalry-calls, the French cavalry march, a march
by Dussek, and one of Pleyel's allegros; again
accompanied by the orchestra. In the <i>Journal
des Modes</i>, whence this account is derived, it is
declared that the tones produced by Maelzel's
automaton were even fuller and richer than those
got out of a trumpet by human lungs and lips;
because a man's breath imparts to the inside of
the instrument a moisture which deteriorates the
quality of the tone.</p>

<p>Vaucanson has, however, never been outdone;
after his Flautist, he produced a figure which accompanied
a flageolet played with one hand, with
a tambourine struck with the other. But his
most wonderful achievements were in imitating
animals. His duck became a wonder of the
world. He simulated nature in the minutest
point. Every bone, every fibre, every organ,
were so accurately constructed and fitted, that
the mechanism waddled about in search of grain;
and, when it found some, picked it up with its
bill and swallowed it. "This grain" (we quote
from the <i>Biographie Universelle</i>) "produced in
the stomach a species of trituration, which caused
it to pass into the intestines, and to perform all
the functions of digestion." The wonderful
duck was not to be distinguished from any live
duck. It muddled the water with its beak, drank,
and quacked to the life. From men and ducks
Vaucanson descended to insects. When Marmontel
brought out his tragedy of "Cleopatra,"
Vaucanson obliged the author with a mechanical
Aspic, in order that the heroine might be stung
with the closest imitation of nature. At the
proper moment the insect darted forth from the
side-scenes, and settled upon the actress, hissing
all the while. A wit, on being asked his opinion
of the play, answered pithily, "<i>I</i> agree with the
Aspic."</p>

<p>One never contemplates these wonders without
regretting that so much mechanical genius
should have been mis-expended upon objects by
which mankind are no gainers beyond a little
fleeting gratification. Vaucanson did not, however,
wholly waste himself upon ingenious trifling.
He was appointed by Cardinal Fleury,
Inspector of Silk Manufactories, into which he
introduced, during a visit to Lyons, some labor-saving
improvements. In return for this, the
workmen stoned him out of the town; but he
conveyed his opinion of their folly by constructing
and setting to work a machine which produced
a very respectable flower pattern in silk
damask by the aid of an Ass. Had his genius
confined itself wholly to the useful arts, it is not
to be doubted that Vaucanson would have advanced
the productive powers of machinery, and,
consequently, the prosperity of mankind, at least
half a century. In point of abstract ingenuity,
his useless contrivances equal, if they do not exceed
in inventive power and mechanical skill,
the important achievements of Arkwright and
Watt. Vaucanson's inventions died with him;
those of the great English engineers will live to
increase the happiness and comfort of mankind
forever.</p>

<p>Single mechanical figures, including the automaton
Chess-player (which was scarcely a fair
deception, and is too well known to need more
than a passing allusion), although surprising for
their special performances, were hardly more attractive
than the groups of automata which have
been from time to time exhibited. One of the
Memoirs of the French Academy of Sciences
describes, in 1729, a set of mechanical puppets,
which were at that time performing a pantomime
in five acts. In 1746, Bienfait, the show-man,
brought out "The Bombardment of the City of
Antwerp," which was performed in the most
soldier-like manner, by automata; all the artillery
being served and discharged with that regularity
which is always attributed to clock-work. A
year or two later, the same artist produced "The
Grand Assault of Bergem-op-Zoom," with unequivocal
success. He called his company <i>Com&eacute;diens
praticiens</i>.</p>

<p>The latest notable effort of mechanical puppet
manufacture is exhibited at Boulogne at the present
time. It is that of a jeweler, who has devoted
eight years of his life to the perfection of
a clock-work conjuror; which he has made a
thorough master of the thimble-rig. Dressed in
an Eastern costume, this necromancer stands behind
a table, covered, as the tables of professors
of legerdemain usually are, with little boxes and
cabinets, from which he takes the objects he employs
during the exhibition. He produces his
goblets, and shows the balls under them; which
vanish and reappear in the most approved style:
now two or three are conjured into a spot, a moment
before vacant; presently, these disappear
again, and are perpetually divided and re-united.</p>

<p>At every exclamation of the spectators, the
little conjuror turns his eyes from side to side, as
if looking round the house; smiles, casts his eyes
modestly down, bows, and resumes his sleight-of-hand.
He not only takes up the goblets from
a stand, and places them over the balls, but leaves
them there for a minute, and holds his hands up,
to show the audience that he conceals nothing in
his palm or sleeve. He then seizes the goblets
again and goes on. This trick over, he puts his
cups away, and shuts his cabinet. He then
knocks on his table, and up starts an egg, to
which he points, to secure attention; he touches
the egg (which opens lengthwise) and a little
<a class="pagenum" id="page_636" title="pg 636"></a>
bird starts into life; sings a roundelay, claps its
enameled wings&mdash;which are of real hummingbirds'
feathers, beyond any metallic art in lustre&mdash;and
then falls back into its egg. The little
conjuror nods, smiles, rolls his eyes right and
left, bows as before, and the egg disappears into
the table; he bows again, and then sits down to
intimate that the performance is over. The
height of this little gentleman is about three
inches; his table and every thing else being in
due proportion. He stands on a high square
pedestal, apparently of marble. It is, however,
of tin, painted white, and within it are all the
wheels and works containing the heart of the
mystery.</p>

<p>This jeweler sold to a dealer, who re-sold to a
Persian Prince, not long since, a Marionnette
flute-player; but whose fingering in the most
elaborate pieces, although as accurate as if Drouet
or Nicholson had been the performers, had no
influence over the tune; which was played by a
concealed musical box. It was therefore, much
inferior to those mechanical flautists we have already
described. The jeweler has never ceased
to regret having sold this toy. He could have
borne to have parted with it if it had remained
in Europe, but that it should have been conveyed,
as he says, "to the other world," has been
too cruel a blow. "<i>Tout le monde</i>," he exclaims,
"<i>sera enchant&eacute; de mon ouvrage; mais, on ne
parlera pas de moi, l&agrave;-bas</i>"&mdash;all the world will
be enchanted with my work, but no one will
speak of me yonder&mdash;by which distant region, he
probably means Ispahan.</p>

<p>He is now perfecting a beautiful bird, which
flies from spray to spray, and sings when it
alights, somewhat similarly to the little Swiss
bird which warbled so sweetly at the Great Exhibition.</p>

<h2 id="MY_TRAVELING_COMPANION">MY TRAVELING COMPANION.</h2>

<p class="drop">My picture was a failure. Partial friends had
guaranteed its success; but the Hanging
Committee and the press are not composed of
one's partial friends. The Hanging Committee
thrust me into the darkest corner of the octagon-room,
and the press ignored my existence&mdash;excepting
in one instance, when my critic dismissed
me in a quarter of a line as a "presumptuous
dauber." I was stunned with the blow, for I had
counted so securely on the &pound;200 at which my
grand historical painting was dog-cheap&mdash;not to
speak of the deathless fame which it was to create
for me&mdash;that I felt like a mere wreck when my
hopes were flung to the ground, and the untasted
cup dashed from my lips. I took to my bed, and
was seriously ill. The doctor bled me till I fainted,
and then said, that he had saved me from a
brain-fever. That might be, but he very nearly
threw me into a consumption, only that I had a
deep chest and a good digestion. Pneumonic
expansion and active chyle saved me from an
early tomb, yet I was too unhappy to be grateful.</p>

<p>But why did my picture fail? Surely it possessed
all the elements of success! It was
grandly historical in subject, original in treatment,
pure in coloring; what, then, was wanting?
This old warrior's head, of true Saxon
type, had all the majesty of Michael Angelo; that
young figure, all the radiant grace of Correggio;
no Rembrandt showed more severe dignity than
yon burnt umber monk in the corner; and Titian
never excelled the loveliness of this cobalt virgin
in the foreground. Why did it not succeed?
The subject, too&mdash;the "Finding of the Body of
Harold by Torch-light"&mdash;-was sacred to all English
hearts; and being conceived in an entirely
new and original manner, it was redeemed from
the charge of triteness and wearisomeness. The
composition was pyramidal, the apex being a torch
home aloft for the "high light," and the base
showing some very novel effects of herbage and
armor. But it failed. All my skill, all my hope,
my ceaseless endeavor, my burning visions, all&mdash;all
had failed; and I was only a poor, half-starved
painter, in Great Howland-street, whose landlady
was daily abating in her respect, and the butcher
daily abating in his punctuality; whose garments
were getting threadbare, and his dinners hypothetical,
and whose day-dreams of fame and fortune
had faded into the dull-gray of penury
and disappointment. I was broken-hearted, ill,
hungry; so I accepted an invitation from a friend,
a rich manufacturer in Birmingham, to go down
to his house for the Christmas holidays. He had
a pleasant place in the midst of some iron-works,
the blazing chimneys of which, he assured me,
would afford me some exquisite studies of "light"
effects.</p>

<p>By mistake, I went by the Express train, and
so was thrown into the society of a lady whose
position would have rendered any acquaintance
with her impossible, excepting under such chance-conditions
as the present; and whose history, as
I learned it afterward, led me to reflect much on
the difference between the reality and the seeming
of life.</p>

<p>She moved my envy. Yes&mdash;base, mean, low,
unartistic, degrading as is this passion, I felt it
rise up like a snake in my breast when I saw
that feeble woman. She was splendidly dressed&mdash;wrapped
in furs of the most costly kind, trailing
behind; her velvets and lace worth a countess's
dowry. She was attended by obsequious menials;
surrounded by luxuries; her compartment of the
carriage was a perfect palace in all the accessories
which it was possible to collect in so small a
space; and it seemed as though "Cleopatra's
cup" would have been no impracticable draught
for her. She gave me more fully the impression
of luxury, than any person I had ever met with
before; and I thought I had reason when I envied
her.</p>

<p>She was lifted into the carriage carefully;
carefully swathed in her splendid furs and lustrous
velvets; and placed gently, like a wounded bird,
in her warm nest of down. But she moved
languidly, and fretfully thrust aside her servants'
busy hands, indifferent to her comforts, and annoyed
by her very blessings. I looked into her
face: it was a strange face, which had once been
beautiful; but ill-health, and care, and grief, had
<a class="pagenum" id="page_637" title="pg 637"></a>
marked it now with deep lines, and colored it with
unnatural tints. Tears had washed out the roses
from her cheeks, and set large purple rings about
her eyes; the mouth was hard and pinched, but
the eyelids swollen; while the crossed wrinkles
on her brow told the same tale of grief grown
petulant, and of pain grown soured, as the thin
lip, quivering and querulous, and the nervous
hand, never still and never strong.</p>

<p>The train-bell rang, the whistle sounded, the
lady's servitors stood bareheaded and courtesying
to the ground, and the rapid rush of the iron giant
bore off the high-born dame and the starveling
painter in strange companionship. Unquiet and
unresting&mdash;now shifting her place&mdash;now letting
down the glass for the cold air to blow full upon
her withered face, then drawing it up, and chafing
her hands and feet by the warm-water apparatus
concealed in her <i>chauffe-pied</i>, while shivering as
if in an ague-fit&mdash;sighing deeply&mdash;lost in thought&mdash;wildly
looking out and around for distraction&mdash;she
soon made me ask myself whether my envy
of her was as true as deep sympathy and pity
would have been.</p>

<p>"But her wealth&mdash;her wealth!" I thought.
"True she may suffer, but how gloriously she is
solaced! She may weep, but the angels of social
life wipe off her tears with perfumed linen, gold
embroidered; she may grieve, but her grief makes
her joys so much the more blissful. Ah! she is
to be envied after all!&mdash;envied, while I, a very
beggar, might well scorn my place now!"</p>

<p>Something of this might have been in my face,
as I offered my sick companion some small attention&mdash;I
forget what&mdash;gathering up one of her
luxurious trifles, or arranging her cushions. She
seemed almost to read my thoughts as her eyes
rested on my melancholy face; and saying
abruptly: "I fear you are unhappy, young man?"
she settled herself in her place like a person prepared
to listen to a pleasant tale.</p>

<p>"I am unfortunate, madam," I answered.</p>

<p>"Unfortunate?" she said impatiently. "What!
with youth and health, can you call yourself unfortunate?
When the whole world lies untried
before you, and you still live in the golden
atmosphere of hope, can you pamper yourself
with sentimental sorrows? Fie upon you!&mdash;fie
upon you! What are your sorrows compared
with mine?"</p>

<p>"I am ignorant of yours, madam," I said, respectfully;
"but I know my own; and, knowing
them, I can speak of their weight and bitterness.
By your very position, you can not undergo the
same kind of distress as that overwhelming me
at this moment: you may have evils in your path
of life, but they can not equal mine."</p>

<p>"Can any thing equal the evils of ruined health
and a desolated hearth?" she cried, still in the
same impatient manner. "Can the worst griefs
of wayward youth equal the bitterness of that cup
which you drink at such a time of life as forbids
all hope of after-assuagement? Can the first
disappointment of a strong heart rank with the
terrible desolation of a wrecked old age? You
think because you see about me the evidences of
wealth, that I must be happy. Young man, I tell
you truly, I would gladly give up every farthing
of my princely fortune, and be reduced to the extreme
of want, to bring back from the grave the
dear ones lying there, or pour into my veins one
drop of the bounding blood of health and energy
which used to make life a long play-hour of delight.
Once, no child in the fields, no bird in the
sky, was more blessed than I; and what am I
now?&mdash;a sickly, lonely old woman, whose nerves
are shattered and whose heart is broken, without
hope or happiness on the earth! Even death has
passed me by in forgetfulness and scorn!"</p>

<p>Her voice betrayed the truth of her emotion.
Still, with an accent of bitterness and complaint,
rather than of simple sorrow, it was the voice of
one fighting against her fate, more than of one
suffering acutely and in despair: it was petulant
rather than melancholy; angry rather than
grieving; showing that her trials had hardened,
not softened her heart.</p>

<p>"Listen to me," she then said, laying her hand
en my arm, "and perhaps my history may reconcile
you to the childish depression, from what
cause soever it may be, under which you are laboring.
You are young and strong, and can
bear any amount of pain as yet: wait until you
reach my age, and then you will know the true
meaning of the word despair! I am rich, as you
may see," she continued, pointing to her surroundings:
"in truth, so rich that I take no
account either of my income or my expenditure.
I have never known life under any other form;
I have never known what it was to be denied the
gratification of one desire which wealth could
purchase, or obliged to calculate the cost of a
single undertaking. I can scarcely realize the
idea of poverty. I see that all people do not live
in the same style as myself; but I can not understand
that it is from inability: it always
seems to me to be from their own disinclination.
I tell you, I can not fully realize the idea of poverty;
and you think this must make me happy,
perhaps?" she added, sharply, looking full in my
face.</p>

<p>"I should be happy, madam, if I were rich," I
replied. "Suffering now from the strain of poverty,
it is no marvel if I place an undue value on
plenty."</p>

<p>"Yet see what it does for me!" continued my
companion. "Does it give me back my husband,
my brave boys, my beautiful girl? Does it give
rest to this weary heart, or relief to this aching
head? Does it soothe my mind or heal my body?
No! It but oppresses me, like a heavy robe thrown
round weakened limbs: it is even an additional
misfortune, for if I were poor, I should be obliged
to think of other things besides myself and my
woes; and the very mental exertion necessary
to sustain my position would lighten my miseries.
I have seen my daughter wasting year by year
and day by day, under the warm sky of the south&mdash;under
the warm care of love! Neither climate
nor affection could save her: every effort was
made&mdash;the best advice procured&mdash;the latest panacea
adopted; but to no effect. Her life was
<a class="pagenum" id="page_638" title="pg 638"></a>
prolonged, certainly; but this simply means, that
she was three years in dying, instead of three
months. She was a gloriously lovely creature,
like a fair young saint for beauty and purity&mdash;quite
an ideal thing, with her golden hair and
large blue eyes! She was my only girl&mdash;my
youngest, my darling, my best treasure! My
first real sorrow&mdash;now fifteen years ago&mdash;was
when I saw her laid, on her twenty-first birthday,
in the English burial-ground at Madeira.
It is on the grave-stone, that she died of consumption:
would that it had been added&mdash;and
her mother of grief! From the day of her death,
my happiness left me!"</p>

<p>Here the poor lady paused, and buried her face
in her hands. The first sorrow was evidently
also the keenest; and I felt my own eyelids moist
as I watched this outpouring of the mother's anguish.
After all, here was grief beyond the power
of wealth to assuage: here was sorrow deeper
than any mere worldly disappointment.</p>

<p>"I had two sons," she went on to say, after a
short time&mdash;"only two. They were fine young
men, gifted and handsome. In fact, all my children
were allowed to be very models of beauty.
One entered the army, the other the navy. The
eldest went with his regiment to the Cape, where
he married a woman of low family&mdash;an infamous
creature of no blood; though she was decently
conducted for a low-born thing as she was. She
was well-spoken of by those who knew her; but
what <i>could</i> she be with a butcher for a grandfather!
However, my poor infatuated son loved
her to the last. She was very pretty, I have
heard&mdash;young, and timid; but being of such fearfully
low origin, of course she could not be recognized
by my husband or myself! We forbade
my son all intercourse with us, unless he would
separate himself from her; but the poor boy was
perfectly mad, and he preferred this low-born
wife to his father and mother. They had a little
baby, who was sent over to me when the wife
died&mdash;for, thank God! she did die in a few years'
time. My son was restored to our love, and he
received our forgiveness; but we never saw him
again. He took a fever of the country, and was a
corpse in a few hours. My second boy was in the
navy&mdash;a fine, high-spirited fellow, who seemed to
set all the accidents of life at defiance. I could not
believe in any harm coming to <i>him</i>. He was so
strong, so healthy, so beautiful, so bright: he
might have been immortal, for all the elements
of decay that showed themselves in him. Yet
this glorious young hero was drowned&mdash;wrecked
off a coral-reef, and flung like a weed on the waters.
He lost his own life in trying to save that
of a common sailor&mdash;a piece of pure gold bartered
for the foulest clay! Two years after this, my
husband died of typhus fever, and I had a nervous
attack, from which I have never recovered.
And now, what do you say to this history of
mine? For fifteen years, I have never been free
from sorrow. No sooner did one grow so familiar
to me, that I ceased to tremble at its hideousness,
than another, still more terrible, came to overwhelm
me in fresh misery. For fifteen years,
my heart has never known an hour's peace; and
to the end of my life, I shall be a desolate, miserable,
broken-hearted woman. Can you understand,
now, the valuelessness of my riches, and
how desolate my splendid house must seem to
me? They have been given me for no useful
purpose here or hereafter; they encumber me,
and do no good to others. Who is to have them
when I die? Hospitals and schools? I hate the
medical profession, and I am against the education
of the poor. I think it the great evil of the
day, and I would not leave a penny of mine to
such a radical wrong. What is to become of my
wealth&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Your grandson," I interrupted, hastily: "the
child of the officer."</p>

<p>The old woman's face gradually softened. "Ah!
he is a lovely boy," she said; "but I don't love
him&mdash;no, I don't," she repeated, vehemently. "If
I set my heart on him, he will die or turn out ill:
take to the low ways of his wretched mother, or
die some horrible death. I steel my heart against
him, and shut him out from my calculations of
the future. He is a sweet boy: interesting, affectionate,
lovely; but I will not allow myself to
love him, and I don't allow him to love me! But
you ought to see him. His hair is like my own
daughter's&mdash;long, glossy, golden hair; and his
eyes are large and blue, and the lashes curl on
his cheek like heavy fringes. He is too pale and
too thin: he looks sadly delicate; but his wretched
mother was a delicate little creature, and he
has doubtless inherited a world of disease and
poor blood from her. I wish he was here though,
for you to see; but I keep him at school, for
when he is much with me, I feel myself beginning
to be interested in him; and I do not wish
to love him&mdash;I do not wish to remember him at
all! With that delicate frame and nervous temperament,
he <i>must</i> die; and why should I prepare
fresh sorrow for myself, by taking him into
my heart, only to have him plucked out again by
death?"</p>

<p>All this was said with the most passionate
vehemence of manner, as if she were defending
herself against some unjust charge. I said something
in the way of remonstrance. Gently and
respectfully, but firmly, I spoke of the necessity
for each soul to spiritualize its aspirations, and
to raise itself from the trammels of earth; and
in speaking thus to her, I felt my own burden
lighten off my heart, and I acknowledged that I
had been both foolish and sinful in allowing my
first disappointment to shadow all the sunlight of
my existence. I am not naturally of a desponding
disposition, and nothing but a blow as severe as
the non-success of my "Finding the Body of
Harold by Torch-light" could have affected me
to the extent of mental prostration, as that under
which I was now laboring. But this was
very hard to bear! My companion listened to
me with a kind of blank surprise, evidently unaccustomed
to the honesty of truth; but she
bore my remarks patiently, and when I had ended,
she even thanked me for my advice.</p>

<p>"And now, tell me the cause of your melancholy
<a class="pagenum" id="page_639" title="pg 639"></a>
face?" she asked, as we were nearing Birmingham.
"Your story can not be very long,
and I shall have just enough time to hear it."</p>

<p>I smiled at her authoritative tone, and said
quietly: "I am an artist, madam, and I had
counted much on the success of my first historical
painting. It has failed, and I am both penniless
and infamous. I am the 'presumptuous
dauber' of the critics&mdash;despised by my creditors&mdash;emphatically
a failure throughout."</p>

<p>"Pshaw!" cried the lady, impatiently; "and
what is that for a grief! a day's disappointment
which a day's labor can repair! To me, your
troubles seem of no more worth than a child's
tears when he has broken his newest toy! Here
is Birmingham, and I must bid you farewell.
Perhaps you will open the door for me? Good-morning:
you have made my journey pleasant,
and relieved my ennui. I shall be happy to see
you in town, and to help you forward in your
career."</p>

<p>And with these words, said in a strange, indifferent,
matter-of-fact tone, as of one accustomed
to all the polite offers of good society,
which mean nothing tangible, she was lifted
from the carriage by a train of servants, and
borne off the platform.</p>

<p>I looked at the card which she placed in my
hand, and read the address of "Mrs. Arden,
Belgrave-square."</p>

<p>I found my friend waiting for me; and in a
few moments was seated before a blazing fire in
a magnificent drawing-room, surrounded with
every comfort that hospitality could offer, or
luxury invent.</p>

<p>"Here, at least, is happiness," I thought, as
I saw the family assemble in the drawing-room
before dinner. "Here are beauty, youth, wealth,
position&mdash;all that makes life valuable. What
concealed skeleton can there be in this house to
frighten away one grace of existence? None&mdash;none!
They must be happy; and, oh! what
a contrast to that poor lady I met with to-day;
and what a painful contrast to myself!"</p>

<p>And all my former melancholy returned like
a heavy cloud upon my brow; and I felt that I
stood like some sad ghost in a fairy-land of
beauty, so utterly out of place was my gloom in
the midst of all this gayety and splendor.</p>

<p>One daughter attracted my attention more
than the rest. She was the eldest, a beautiful
girl of about twenty-three, or she might have
been even a few years older. Her face was quite
of the Spanish style&mdash;dark, expressive, and tender;
and her manners were the softest and most
bewitching I had ever seen. She was peculiarly
attractive to an artist, from the exceeding beauty
of feature, as well as from the depth of expression
which distinguished her. I secretly sketched
her portrait on my thumb-nail, and in my own
mind I determined to make her the model for my
next grand attempt at historical composition&mdash;"the
Return of Columbus." She was to be
the Spanish queen; and I thought of myself as
Ferdinand; for I was not unlike a Spaniard in
appearance, and I was almost as brown.</p>

<p>I remained with my friend a fortnight, studying
the midnight effects of the iron-foundries,
and cultivating the acquaintance of Julia. In
these two congenial occupations, the time passed
like lightning, and I woke as from a pleasant
dream, to the knowledge of the fact, that my
visit was expected to be brought to a close. I
had been asked, I remembered, for a week, and
I had doubled my furlough. I hinted at breakfast,
that I was afraid I must leave my kind
friends to-morrow, and a general regret was
expressed, but no one asked me to stay longer;
so the die was unhappily cast.</p>

<p>Julia was melancholy. I could not but observe
it; and I confess that the observation
caused me more pleasure than pain. Could it
be sorrow at my departure? We had been daily,
almost hourly, companions for fourteen days,
and the surmise was not unreasonable. She
had always shown me particular kindness, and
she could not but have seen my marked preference
for her. My heart beat wildly as I gazed on
her pale cheek and drooping eyelid; for though
she had been always still and gentle, I had never
seen&mdash;certainly I had never noticed&mdash;such evident
traces of sorrow, as I saw in her face to-day.
Oh, if it were for me, how I would bless
each pang which pained that beautiful heart!&mdash;how
I would cherish the tears that fell, as if they
had been priceless diamonds from the mine!&mdash;how
I would joy in her grief and live in her despair!
It might be that out of evil would come
good, and from the deep desolation of my unsold
"Body" might arise the heavenly blessedness of
such love as this! I was intoxicated with my
hopes; and was on the point of making a public
idiot of myself, but happily some slight remnant
of common sense was left me. However, impatient
to learn my fate, I drew Julia aside; and,
placing myself at her feet, while she was enthroned
on a luxurious ottoman, I pretended that
I must conclude the series of lectures on art,
and the best methods of coloring, on which I
had been employed with her ever since my visit.</p>

<p>"You seem unhappy to-day, Miss Reay," I
said, abruptly, with my voice trembling like a
girl's.</p>

<p>She raised her large eyes languidly. "Unhappy?
no, I am never unhappy," she said,
quietly.</p>

<p>Her voice never sounded so silvery sweet, so
pure and harmonious. It fell like music on the
air.</p>

<p>"I have, then, been too much blinded by excess
of beauty to have been able to see correctly,"
I answered. "To me you have appeared
always calm, but never sad; but to-day there is
a palpable weight of sorrow on you, which a
child might read. It is in your voice, and on
your eyelids, and round your lips; it is on you
like the moss on the young rose&mdash;beautifying
while vailing the dazzling glory within."</p>

<p>"Ah! you speak far too poetically for me,"
said Julia, smiling. "If you will come down to
my level for a little while, and will talk to me
rationally, I will tell you my history. I will tell
<a class="pagenum" id="page_640" title="pg 640"></a>
it you as a lesson for yourself, which I think
will do you good."</p>

<p>The cold chill that went to my soul! Her
history! It was no diary of facts that I wanted
to hear, but only a register of feelings&mdash;a register
of feelings in which I should find myself the
only point whereto the index was set. History!
what events deserving that name could have
troubled the smooth waters of her life?</p>

<p>I was silent, for I was disturbed; but Julia did
not notice either my embarrassment or my silence,
and began, in her low, soft voice, to open
one of the saddest chapters of life which I had
ever heard.</p>

<p>"You do not know that I am going into a
convent?" she said; then, without waiting for
an answer, she continued: "This is the last
month of my worldly life. In four weeks, I shall
have put on the white robe of the novitiate, and
in due course I trust to be dead forever to this
earthly life."</p>

<p>A heavy, thick, choking sensation in my throat,
and a burning pain within my eyeballs, warned
me to keep silence. My voice would have betrayed
me.</p>

<p>"When I was seventeen," continued Julia,
"I was engaged to my cousin. We had been
brought up together from childhood, and we
loved each other perfectly. You must not think,
because I speak so calmly now, that I have not
suffered in the past. It is only by the grace
of resignation and of religion, that I have been
brought to my present condition of spiritual
peace. I am now five-and-twenty&mdash;next week
I shall be six-and-twenty: that is just nine years
since I was first engaged to Laurence. He was
not rich enough, and indeed he was far too
young, to marry, for he was only a year older
than myself; and if he had had the largest possible
amount of income, we could certainly not
have married for three years. My father never
cordially approved of the engagement, though he
did not oppose it. Laurence was taken partner
into a large concern here, and a heavy weight of
business was immediately laid on him. Youthful
as he was, he was made the sole and almost
irresponsible agent in a house which counted its
capital by millions, and through which gold flowed
like water. For some time, he went on well&mdash;to
a marvel, well. He was punctual, vigilant,
careful; but the responsibility was too much for
the poor boy: the praises he received, the flattery
and obsequiousness which, for the first time,
were lavished on the friendless youth, the wealth
at his command, all turned his head. For a long
time, we heard vague rumors of irregular conduct;
but as he was always the same good,
affectionate, respectful, happy Laurence, when
with us, even my father, who is so strict, and
somewhat suspicious, turned a deaf ear to them.
I was the earliest to notice a slight change, first
in his face, and then in his manners. At last,
the rumors ceased to be vague, and became definite.
Business neglected; fatal habits visible,
even in the early day; the frightful use of horrible
words, which once he would have trembled
to use; the nights passed at the gaming-table,
and the days spent in the society of the worst
men on the turf&mdash;all these accusations were
brought to my father by credible witnesses; and,
alas! they were too true to be refuted. My father&mdash;heaven
and the holy saints bless his gray
head!&mdash;kept them from me as long as he could.
He forgave him again and again, and used every
means that love and reason could employ to
bring him back into the way of right; but he
could do nothing against the force of such fatal
habits as those to which my poor Laurence had
now become wedded. With every good intention,
and with much strong love for me burning
sadly amid the wreck of his virtues, he yet would
not refrain: the evil one had overcome him;
he was his prey here and hereafter. Oh, no&mdash;not
hereafter!" she added, raising her hands and
eyes to heaven, "if prayer, if fasting, patient
vigil, incessant striving, may procure him pardon&mdash;not
forever his prey! Our engagement
was broken off; and this step, necessary as it
was, completed his ruin. He died...." Here
a strong shudder shook her from head to foot
and I half rose, in alarm. The next instant she
was calm.</p>

<p>"Now, you know my history," continued she.
"It is a tragedy of real life, which you will do
well, young painter, to compare with your own!"
With a kindly pressure of the hand, and a gentle
smile&mdash;oh! so sweet, so pure and heavenly!&mdash;Julia
Reay left me; while I sat perfectly awed&mdash;that
is the only word I can use&mdash;with the
revelation which she had made both of her history
and of her own grand soul.</p>

<p>"Come with me to my study," said Mr. Reay,
entering the room; "I have a world to talk to
you about. You go to-morrow, you say. I am
sorry for it; but I must therefore settle my
business with you in good time to-day."</p>

<p>I followed him mechanically, for I was undergoing
a mental castigation which rather disturbed
me. Indeed, like a young fool&mdash;as eager
in self-reproach as in self-glorification&mdash;I was so
occupied in inwardly calling myself hard names,
that even when my host gave me a commission
for my new picture, "The Return of Columbus,"
at two hundred and fifty pounds, together
with an order to paint himself, Mrs. Reay, and
half-a-dozen of their children, I confess it with
shame, that I received the news like a leaden
block, and felt neither surprise nor joy&mdash;not
though these few words chased me from the
gates of the Fleet, whither I was fast hastening,
and secured me both position and daily bread.
The words of that beautiful girl were still ringing
in my ears, mixed up with the bitterest self-accusations;
and these together shut out all other
sound, however pleasant. But that was always
my way.</p>

<p>I went back to London, humbled and yet
strengthened, having learned more of human
nature and the value of events, in one short
fortnight, than I had ever dreamed of before.
The first lessons of youth generally come in
hard shape. I had sense enough to feel that I
<a class="pagenum" id="page_641" title="pg 641"></a>
had learned mine gently, and that I had cause
to be thankful for the mildness of the teaching.
From a boy, I became a man, judging more accurately
of humanity than a year's ordinary experience
would have enabled me to do. And the
moral which I drew was this: that under our
most terrible afflictions, we may always gain
some spiritual good, if we suffer them to be softening
and purifying, rather than hardening influences
over us. And also, that while we are
suffering the most acutely, we may be sure that
others are suffering still more acutely; and if
we would but sympathize with them more than
with ourselves&mdash;live out of our own selves, and
in the wide world around us&mdash;we would soon
be healed while striving to heal others. Of this
I am convinced: the secret of life, and of all its
good, is in love; and while we preserve this, we
can never fail of comfort. The sweet waters will
always gush out over the sandiest desert of our
lives while we can love; but without it&mdash;nay, not
the merest weed of comfort or of virtue would
grow under the feet of angels. In this was the
distinction between Mrs. Arden and Julia Reay.
The one had hardened her heart under her trials,
and shut it up in itself; the other had opened
hers to the purest love of man and love of God;
and the result was to be seen in the despair of
the one, and in the holy peace of the other.</p>

<p>Full of these thoughts, I sought out my poor
lady, determined to do her real benefit if I could.
She received me very kindly, for I had taken
care to provide myself with a sufficient introduction,
so as to set all doubts of my social position
at rest: and I knew how far this would go with
her. We soon became fast friends. She seemed
to rest on me much for sympathy and comfort,
and soon grew to regard me with a sort of
motherly fondness that of itself brightened her
life. I paid her all the attention which a devoted
son might pay&mdash;humored her whims,
soothed her pains; but insensibly I led her mind
out from itself&mdash;-first in kindness to me, and then
in love to her grandson.</p>

<p>I asked for him just before the midsummer
holidays, and with great difficulty obtained an
invitation for him to spend them with her. She
resisted my entreaties stoutly, but at last was
obliged to yield; not to me, nor to my powers
of persuasion, but to the holy truth of which I
was then the advocate. The child came, and I
was there also to receive him, and to enforce by
my presence&mdash;which I saw, without vanity, had
great influence&mdash;a fitting reception. He was a
pensive, clever, interesting little fellow; sensitive
and affectionate, timid, gifted with wonderful
powers, and of great beauty. There was a
shy look in his eyes, which made me sure that
he inherited much of his loveliness from his
mother; and when we were great friends, he
showed me a small portrait of "Poor mamma;"
and I saw at once the most striking likeness
between the two. No human heart could withstand
that boy, certainly not my poor friend's.
She yielded, fighting desperately against me
and him, and all the powers of love, which were
subduing her, but yielding while she fought;
and in a short time the child had taken his proper
place in her affections, which he kept to the
end of her life. And she, that desolate mother,
even she, with her seared soul and petrified
heart, was brought to the knowledge of peace
by the glorious power of love.</p>

<p>Prosperous, famous, happy, blessed in home
and hearth, this has become my fundamental
creed of life, the basis on which all good, whether
of art or of morality, is rested: of art especially;
for only by a tender, reverent spirit can the true
meaning of his vocation be made known to the
artist. All the rest is mere imitation of form, not
insight into essence. And while I feel that I can
live out of myself, and love others&mdash;the whole
world of man&mdash;more than myself, I know that I
possess the secret of happiness; ay, though my
powers were suddenly blasted as by lightning,
my wife and children laid in the cold grave, and
my happy home desolated forever. For I would
go out into the thronged streets, and gather up
the sorrows of others, to relieve them; and I
would go out under the quiet sky, and look up
to the Father's throne; and I would pluck peace,
as green herbs from active benevolence and contemplative
adoration. Yes; love can save from
the sterility of selfishness, and from the death
of despair; but love alone. No other talisman
has the power; pride, self-sustainment, coldness,
pleasure, nothing&mdash;nothing&mdash;but that divine
word of Life which is life's soul!</p>

<h2 id="THE_LITTLE_SISTERS">THE LITTLE SISTERS.</h2>

<p class="drop">Almsgiving takes the place of the work-house
system, in the economy of a large
part of Europe. The giving of alms to the helpless
is, moreover, in Catholic countries, a religious
office. The voluntary surrender of gifts,
each according to his ability, as a means of grace,
is more prominently insisted upon than among
Protestants; consequently systematic taxation
for the poor is not resorted to. Nor is there so
great a necessity for it as in England; for few
nations have so many paupers to provide for
as the English are accustomed to regard as a
natural element in society; and thus it happens,
that when, about ten years ago, there was
in France no asylum but the hospital, for aged
and ailing poor, the want of institutions for the
infirm but healthy was not so severe as to attract
the public eye.</p>

<p>But there was at that time a poor servant-woman,
a native of the village of La Croix, in
Brittany&mdash;Jeanne Sugon was her name&mdash;who
was moved by the gentleness of her heart, and
the fervor of her religion, to pity a certain infirm
and destitute neighbor, to take her to her side as
a companion, and to devote herself to her support.
Other infirm people earned, by their helplessness,
a claim on her attention. She went
about begging, when she could not work, that
she might preserve life as long as Nature would
grant it to her infirm charges. Her example
spread a desire for the performance of similar
good offices. Two pious women, her neighbors,
<a class="pagenum" id="page_642" title="pg 642"></a>
united with Jeanne in her pious office. These
women cherished, as they were able, aged and
infirm paupers; nursed them in a little house,
and begged for them in the vicinity. The three
women, who had so devoted themselves, attracted
notice, and were presently received into the
order of Sisters of Charity, in which they took
for themselves the name of "Little Sisters of the
Poor"&mdash;<span class="smcap">Petites S&oelig;rs des Pauvres</span>.</p>

<p>The first house of the Little Sisters of the
Poor was opened at St. Servan, in Brittany. A
healthy flower scatters seed around. We saw
that forcibly illustrated, in the progress, from an
origin equally humble, of the Rauhe Haus, near
Hamburgh: we see it now again, in the efforts of
the Little Sisters, which flourished and fructified
with prompt usefulness. On the tenth anniversary
of the establishment at St. Servan, ten similar
houses had been founded in ten different
French towns.</p>

<p>The <i>Petites S&oelig;urs</i> live with their charges in
the most frugal way, upon the scraps and waste
meat which they can collect from the surrounding
houses. The voluntary contributions by which
they support their institution, are truly the
crumbs falling from the rich man's table. The
nurse fares no better than the objects of her care.
She lives upon equal terms with Lazarus, and acts
toward him in the spirit of a younger sister.</p>

<p>The establishment at Dinan, over which Jeanne
Sugon herself presides, being under repair, and
not quite fit for the reception of visitors, we will
go over the Sisters' house at Paris, which is conducted
on exactly the same plan.</p>

<p>We are ushered into a small parlor, scantily
furnished, with some Scripture prints upon the
walls. A Sister enters to us with such a bright
look of cheerfulness as faces wear when hearts
beneath them feel that they are beating to some
purpose in the world. She accedes gladly to our
desire, and at once leads us into another room of
larger size, in which twenty or thirty old women
are at this moment finishing their dinner; it being
Friday, rice stands on the table in the place of
meat. The Sister moves and speaks with the
gentleness of a mother among creatures who are
in, or are near to the state of second childhood.
You see an old dame fumbling eagerly over her
snuff-box lid. The poor creatures are not denied
luxuries; for, whatever they can earn by their
spinning is their own money, and they buy with
it any indulgences they please; among which
nothing is so highly prized or eagerly coveted as
a pinch of snuff.</p>

<p>In the dormitories on the first floor, some lie
bed-ridden. Gentler still, if possible, is now the
Sister's voice. The rooms throughout the house
are airy, with large windows, and those inhabited
by the Sisters are distinguished from the rest
by no mark of indulgence or superiority.</p>

<p>We descend now into the old men's department;
and enter a warm room, with a stove in
the centre. One old fellow has his feet upon a
little foot-warmer, and thinly pipes out, that he
is very comfortable now, for he is always warm.
The chills of age, and the chills of the cold pavement
remain together in his memory; but he is
very comfortable now&mdash;very comfortable. An
other decrepit man, with white hair and bowed
back&mdash;who may have been proud, in his youth,
of a rich voice for love-song, talks of music to
the Sister; and, on being asked to sing, blazes
out with joyous gestures, and strikes up a song
of B&eacute;ranger's in a cracked, shaggy voice, which
sometimes&mdash;like a river given to flow under
ground&mdash;is lost entirely, and then bubbles up
again, quite thick with mud.</p>

<p>We go into a little oratory, where all pray together
nightly before they retire to rest. Thence
we descend into a garden for the men; and pass
thence by a door into the women's court. The
chapel-bell invites us to witness the assembly of
the Sisters for the repetition of their psalms and
litanies. From the chapel we return into the
court, and enter a large room, where the women
are all busy with their spinning-wheels. One
old soul immediately totters to the Sister (not
the same Sister with whom we set out), and
insists on welcoming her daughter with a kiss.
We are informed that it is a delusion of her
age to recognize in this Sister really her own
child, who is certainly far away, and may possibly
be dead. The Sister embraces her affectionately,
and does nothing to disturb the pleasant
thought.</p>

<p>And now we go into the kitchen. Preparation
for coffee is in progress. The dregs of coffee
that have been collected from the houses of the
affluent in the neighborhood, are stewed for a
long time with great care. The Sisters say they
produce a very tolerable result; and, at any rate,
every inmate is thus enabled to have a cup of
coffee every morning, to which love is able to
administer the finest Mocha flavor. A Sister
enters from her rounds out of doors with two
cans full of broken victuals. She is a healthy,
and, I think, a handsome woman. Her daily
work is to go out with the cans directly after
she has had her morning coffee, and to collect
food for the ninety old people that are in the
house. As fast as she fills her cans, she brings
them to the kitchen, and goes out again; continuing
in this work daily till four o'clock.</p>

<p>You do not like this begging? What are the
advertisements on behalf of our own hospitals?
what are the collectors? what are the dinners,
the speeches, the charity sermons? A few weak
women, strong in heart, without advertisement,
or dinners, or charity sermons; without urgent
appeals to a sympathizing public; who have no
occasion to exercitate charity, by enticing it to
balls and to theatrical benefits; patiently collect
waste food from house to house, and feed the
poor with it, humbly and tenderly.</p>

<p>The cans are now to be emptied; the contents
being divided into four compartments, according
to their nature&mdash;broken meat, vegetables, slices
of pudding, fish, &amp;c. Each is afterward submitted
to the best cookery that can be contrived.
The choicest things are set aside&mdash;these, said a
Sister, with a look of satisfaction, will be for our
poor dear sick.
<a class="pagenum" id="page_643" title="pg 643"></a></p>

<p>The number of Sisters altogether in this house
engaged in attendance on the ninety infirm paupers,
is fourteen. They divide the duties of the
house among themselves. Two serve in the
kitchen, two in the laundry; one begs, one devotes
herself to constant personal attendance on
the wants of the old men, and so on with the
others, each having her special department. The
whole sentiment of the household is that of a
very large and very amiable family. To feel
that they console the last days of the infirm and
aged poor, is all the Little Sisters get for their
hard work.</p>

<h2 id="HOW_GUNPOWDER_IS_MADE_VISIT">HOW GUNPOWDER IS MADE.&mdash;VISIT
TO HOUNSLOW MILLS.</h2>

<p class="drop">Hounslow Gunpowder Mills are not so
much like a special "town," as so many
other large manufactories appear, but rather
have the appearance of an infant colony&mdash;a very
infant one, inasmuch as it has very few inhabitants.
We never met a single man in all our
rambles through the plantations, nor heard the
sound of a human voice. It is like a strange
new settlement, where there is ample space,
plenty of wood and water, but with scarcely any
colonists, and only here and there a log-hut or a
dark shed among the trees.</p>

<p>These works are distributed over some hundred
and fifty acres of land, without reckoning
the surface of the Colne, which, sometimes broad,
sometimes narrow, sometimes in a line, and sometimes
coiling, and escaping by a curve out of
sight, intersects the whole place. It is, in fact,
a great straggling plantation of firs, over swells
and declivities of land, with a branch or neck of
a river meeting you unexpectedly at almost every
turn. The more we have seen of this dismal
settlement "in the bush," the more do we revert
to our first impression on entering it. The place
is like the strange and squalid plantation of some
necromancer in Spenser's "Fairy Queen." Many
trees are black and shattered, as if by lightning;
others distorted, writhing, and partially stripped
of their bark; and all of them have a sort of conscious
look that this is a very precarious spot for
the regular progress of vegetation. You wander
up narrow winding paths, and you descend narrow
winding paths; you see the broad arm of a
river, with little swampy osier islands upon it,
and then you enter another plantation, and come
upon a narrow winding neck of river, leading up
to a great black slanting structure, which you are
told is a "blast-wall;" and behind this is the
green embankment of a fortification, and further
back you come upon one of the black, ominous-looking
powder "houses." You advance along
other tortuous paths, you cross small bridges,
and again you enter a plantation, more or less
sombre, and presently emerge upon an open
space, where you see a semicircular road of red
gravel, with cart-ruts deeply trenched in it; and
then another narrower road down to a branch of
the river, where there is another little bridge;
and beyond this, on the other side, you see a
huge water-wheel revolving between two black
barn-like houses. You ascend a slope, by a path
of mud and slush, and arriving at another larger
open space, you find yourself in front of a sheet
of water, and in the distance you observe one
enormous wheel&mdash;the diabolical queen of all the
rest&mdash;standing, black and immovable, like an antediluvian
skeleton, against the dull, gray sky,
with a torrent of water running in a long narrow
gully from beneath its lower spokes, as if disgorged
before its death. This open space is
surrounded by trees, above which, high over all,
there rises a huge chimney, or rather tower; and
again, over all this there float clouds of black
smoke, derived from charred wood, if we may
judge of the effect upon our noses and eyes.</p>

<p>At distances from each other, varying from
thirty or forty to a hundred and fifty yards, over
this settlement are distributed, by systematic arrangement
of the intervals, and the obstructive
character of the intervening ground and plantations,
no less than ninety-seven different buildings.
By these means, not only is the danger
divided, but the loss, by an explosion, reduced
to the one "house" in which the accident occurs.
Such, at least, is the intention, though certainly
not always affording the desired protection. The
houses are also, for the most part, constructed
of light materials, where the nature of the operation
will admit of it; sometimes extremely strong
below, but very light above, like a man in armor
with a straw hat; so that if a "puff" comes,
there will be a free way upward, and they hope
to get rid of the fury with no greater loss than a
light roof. In some cases the roofs are of concrete,
and bomb-proof; in others, the roofs are
floated with water in shallow tanks. There are
five steam-engines employed, one being a locomotive;
and the extraordinary number of twenty-six
water-mills, as motive powers for machinery&mdash;obviously
much safer than any other that
could be obtained from the most guarded and
covered-in engines requiring furnaces.</p>

<p>In this silent region, amidst whose ninety-seven
work-places no human voice ever breaks upon the
ear, and where, indeed, no human form is seen
except in the isolated house in which his allotted
task is performed, there are secreted upward of
two hundred and fifty work-people. They are a
peculiar race; not, of course, by nature, in most
cases, but by the habit of years. The circumstances
of momentary destruction in which they
live, added to the most stringent and necessary
regulations, have subdued their minds and feelings
to the conditions of their hire. There is
seldom any need to enforce these regulations.
Some terrific explosion here, or in works of a
similar kind elsewhere, leaves a fixed mark in
their memories, and acts as a constant warning.
Here no shadow of a practical joke, or caper of
animal spirits ever transpires; no witticisms, no
oaths, no chaffing, or slang. A laugh is never
heard; a smile seldom seen. Even the work is
carried on by the men with as few words as possible,
and these uttered in a low tone. Not that
any body fancies that mere sound will awaken the
spirit of combustion, or cause an explosion to
<a class="pagenum" id="page_644" title="pg 644"></a>
take place, but that their feelings are always
kept subdued. If one man wishes to communicate
any thing to another, or to ask for any thing
from somebody at a short distance, he must go
there; he is never permitted to shout or call out.
There is a particular reason for this last regulation.
Amidst all this silence, whenever a shout
<i>does</i> occur, every body knows that some imminent
danger is expected the next moment, and
all rush away headlong from the direction of the
shout. As to running toward it to offer any
assistance, as common in all other cases, it is
thoroughly understood that none can be afforded.
An accident here is immediate and beyond remedy.
If the shouting be continued for some time
(for a man might be drowning in the river), that
might cause one or two of the boldest to return;
but this would be a very rare occurrence. It is
by no means to be inferred that the men are
selfish and insensible to the perils of each other;
on the contrary, they have the greatest consideration
for each other, as well as for their employers,
and think of the danger to the lives of others,
and of the property at stake at all times, and more
especially in all the more dangerous "houses."
The proprietors of the various gunpowder mills
all display the same consideration for each other,
and whenever any improvement tending to lessen
danger is discovered by one, it is immediately
communicated to all the others. The wages of
the men are good, and the hours very short; no
artificial lights are ever used in the works. They
all wash themselves&mdash;black, white, yellow, and
bronze&mdash;and leave the mills at half-past three in
the afternoon, winter and summer.</p>

<p>After several unsuccessful attempts to effect
an entrance into one of the mysterious manufactories&mdash;attributable
solely to the dangers of utter
destruction that momentarily hover over all works
of this kind, and not in the least from any want
of courtesy in the proprietors&mdash;we eventually
obtained permission to inspect these mills owned
by the Messrs. Curtis, which are among the
largest works of the kind in Europe. It was a
very wet day, but that circumstance was rather
favorable than otherwise, as our obliging companion,
Mr. Ashbee, the manager of the works,
considerately informed us. After visiting successively
the mills where the charcoal, saltpetre,
and brimstone, are separately prepared, we plash
our way over the wet path to the "incorporation
mill"&mdash;a sufficiently dangerous place. Having
exchanged our boots for India rubber over-shoes,
we enter and find the machinery&mdash;consisting of
two ponderous, upright millstones, rolling round
like wagon-wheels, in a small circle. In the bed
beneath these huge rolling stones lies, not one,
but the <i>three</i> terrible ingredients of powdered
charcoal, saltpetre, and sulphur, which are thus
incorporated. The bed upon which the stones
roll is of iron; from it the stones would inevitably
strike sparks&mdash;and "there an end of all"&mdash;if
they came in contact in any part. But between
the stones and the iron bed lies the incorporating
powder&mdash;forty pounds of it giving a bed
of intermediate powder, of two or three inches
deep; so that the explosive material is absolutely
the only protection. So long as the powder
lies in this bed with no part of the iron left bare,
all is considered to be safe. To keep it within
the bed, therefore&mdash;while the rolling twist of the
stones is continually displacing it, and rubbing
it outward and inward&mdash;several mechanical contrivances
are adopted, which act like guides, and
scoops, and scrapers; and thus restore, with
regularity, the powder to its proper place, beneath
the stones. A water-wheel keeps this mill
in action. No workmen remain here; but the
time required for the incorporating process being
known, the bed of powder is laid down, the mill
set in motion, and then shut up and left to itself&mdash;as
it ought to be, in case of any little oversight
or "hitch" on the part of the guides, scoops,
or scrapers. The machinery of these mills, as
may be readily credited, is always kept in the
finest order. "And yet," says Mr. Ashbee, in
a whisper; "and yet, five of them&mdash;just such
mills as these&mdash;<i>went off</i> at Faversham, the other
day, one after the other. Nobody knew how."
This seasonable piece of information naturally
increases the peculiar interest we feel in the objects
we are now examining, as they proceed
with their work.</p>

<p>The next house we visit, Mr. Ashbee assures
us, is a very interesting process. To be sure, it
is one of the most dangerous; and what makes
this worse, is the fact that the process is of that
kind which requires the constant presence of the
men. They can not set the machinery to work,
and leave it for a given time; they must always
remain on the spot. It is the "Corning House"
sometimes called "Graining," as it is the process
which reduces the cakes and hard knobs,
into which the gunpowder has been forced by
hydraulic pressure, into grains&mdash;a very nice, and,
it would appear, a sufficiently alarming operation.</p>

<p>Ascending by a rising pathway, we pass over
a mound covered with a plantation of firs, and
descending to a path by the river side, we arrive
at a structure of black timber, some five-and-twenty
feet high, set up in the shape of an acute
angle. This is a "blast-wall," intended to offer
some resistance to a rush of air in case of an explosion
near at hand. There is also a similar
blast-wall on the opposite side of the river.
Passing this structure, we arrive at a green embankment
thrown up as in fortified places, and
behind and beneath this stands the "Corning
House."</p>

<p>It is a low-roofed, black edifice, like the rest,
although, if possible, with a still more dismal
appearance. We know not what causes the impression,
but we could fancy it some place of
torture, devoted to the service of the darkest pagan
superstitions, or those of the Holy Inquisition.
A little black vestibule, or out-house, stands
on the side nearest us. The whole structure is
planted on the river's edge, to which the platform
in front extends. We enter the little vestibule,
and here we go through the ceremony of the
over-shoes. We are then permitted to advance
upon the sacred platform, and we then approach
<a class="pagenum" id="page_645" title="pg 645"></a>
the entrance. If we have received a strange
and unaccountable impression of a place of torture,
from the external appearance and surrounding
circumstances, this is considerably borne out
by the interior. The first thing that seems to
justify this is a dry, strangulated, shrieking cry
which continues at intervals. We discover that
it is the cry of a wooden screw in torment, which
in some sort reconciles us. But the sound lingers,
and the impression too. The flooring is
all covered with leather and hides, all perfectly
black with the dust of gunpowder, and on this
occasion all perfectly dry. We do not much like
that: the wet sliding about was more amusing;
perhaps, also, a trifle safer.</p>

<p>The first object that seizes upon our attention
is a black square frame-work, apparently suspended
from the ceiling. Its ugly perpendicular
beams, and equally uncouth horizontal limbs
would be just the thing to hang the dead bodies
of tortured victims in. We can not help following
up our first impression. The men here, who
stand in silence looking intently at us, all wear
black masks. On the left there is reared a
structure of black wood reaching to within two
or three feet of the roof. It is built up in several
stages, descending like broad steps. Each of
these broad steps contains a sieve made of closely
woven wire, which becomes finer as the steps
get lower and lower. In this machine we noticed
iron axles for the wheels, but our attention
was directed to the rollers, which were of zinc.
Thus the friction does not induce sparks, the
action being also guarded against external blows.
At present the machine is not in motion; and
the men at work here observe their usual silence
and depressing gravity. We conjecture that the
machine, when put in motion, shakes and sifts
the gunpowder in a slow and most cautious manner,
corresponding to the seriousness of the human
workers, and with an almost equal sense of
the consequences of iron mistaking for once the
nature of copper and brass. "Put <i>on</i> the house!"
says Mr. Ashbee, in the calm voice always used
here, and nodding at the same time to the head
corning-man. A rumbling sound is heard&mdash;the
wheels begin to turn&mdash;the black sieves bestir
themselves, moving from side to side; the wheels
turn faster&mdash;the sieves shake and shuffle faster.
We trust there is no mistake. They all get
faster still. We do not wish them to put themselves
to any inconvenience on our account. The
full speed is laid on! The wheels whirl and
buzz&mdash;iron teeth play into brass teeth&mdash;copper
winks at iron&mdash;the black sieves shake their infernal
sides into fury&mdash;the whole machine seems
bent upon its own destruction&mdash;the destruction
of us all! Now&mdash;one small spark&mdash;and in an
instant the whole of this house, with all in it,
would be instantly swept away! Nobody seems
to think of this. And see!&mdash;how the gunpowder
rashes from side to side of the sieves, and
pours down from one stage to the other. We
feel sure that all this must be much faster than
usual. We do not wish it. Why should pride
prevent our requesting that this horror should
cease? We hear, also, an extraordinary noise
behind us. Turning hastily round, we see the
previously immovable black frame-work for the
dead whirling round and round in the air with
frightful rapidity, while two men with wooden
shovels are shoveling up showers of gunpowder,
as if to smother and suffocate its madness. Nothing
but shame&mdash;nothing but shame and an anguish
of self-command, prevents our instantly
darting out of the house&mdash;across the platform&mdash;and
headlong into the river.</p>

<p>What a house&mdash;what a workshop! It is quiet
again. We have not sprung into the river. But
had we been alone here, under such circumstances
for the first time, we should have had no
subsequent respect for our own instincts and
promptitude of action if we had done any thing
else. As it was, the thing is a sensation for life.
We find that the whirling frame-work also contains
sieves&mdash;that the invisible moving power is
by a water-wheel under the flooring, which acts
by a crank. But we are very much obliged already&mdash;we
have had enough of "corning."</p>

<p>We take our departure over the platform&mdash;have
our over-shoes taken off&mdash;and finding that
there is something more to see, we rally and recover
our breath, and are again on the path by
the water's edge. A man is coming down the
river with a small covered barge, carrying powder
from one house to another. We remark that
boating must be one of the safest positions, not
only as unconducive to explosion, but even in
case of its occurring elsewhere. Mr. Ashbee
coincides in this opinion, although, he adds, that
some time ago, a man coming down the river in a
boat&mdash;just as that one is now doing&mdash;had his
right arm blown off. We see that, in truth, <i>
o</i>
position is safe. One may be "blown off" any
where, at any moment. Thus pleasantly conversing
as we walk, we arrive at the "Glazing-House."</p>

<p>The process of glazing consists in mixing
black-lead with gunpowder in large grains, and
glazing, or giving it a fine glossy texture. For
this purpose four barrels containing the grains
are ranged on an axle. They are made to revolve
during four hours, to render them smooth;
black-lead is then added, and they revolve four
hours more. There is iron in this machinery;
but it works upon brass or copper wheels, so that
friction generates heat, but not fire. The process
continues from eight to twenty-four hours,
according to the fineness of polish required; and
the revolution of the barrels sometimes causes the
heat of the gunpowder within to rise to one hundred
and twenty degrees&mdash;even to charring the
wood of the interior of the barrels by the heat
and friction. We inquire what degree of heat
they may be in at the present moment? It is
rather high, we learn; and the head-glazer politely
informs us that we may put our hand and arm
into the barrels and feel the heat. He opens it
at the top for the purpose. We take his word
for it. However, as he inserts one hand and
arm by way of example, we feel in some sort
called upon, for the honor of "Household Words,"
<a class="pagenum" id="page_646" title="pg 646"></a>
to do the same. It is extremely hot, and a most
agreeable sensation. The faces of the men here,
being all black from the powder, and shining
with the addition of the black lead, have the appearance
of grim masks of demons in a pantomime,
or rather of real demons in a mine. Their
eyes look out upon us with a strange intelligence.
They know the figure they present. So
do we. This, added to their subdued voice, and
whispering, and mute gesticulation, and noiseless
moving and creeping about, renders the scene
quite unique; and a little of it goes a great way.</p>

<p>Our time being now short&mdash;our hours, in fact,
being "numbered"&mdash;we move quickly on to the
next house, some hundred yards distant. It is
the "Stoving-house." We approach the door.
Mr. Ashbee is so good as to say there is no need
for us to enter, as the process may be seen from
the door-way. We are permitted to stand upon
the little platform outside, in our boots, dispensing
with the over-shoes. This house is heated
by pipes. The powder is spread upon numerous
wooden trays, and slid into shelves on stands, or
racks. The heat is raised to one hundred and
twenty-five degrees. We salute the head stove-man,
and depart. But turning round to give a
"longing, lingering look behind," we see a large
mop protruded from the door-way. Its round
head seems to inspect the place where we stood
in our boots on the platform. It evidently discovers
a few grains of gravel or grit, and descends
upon them immediately, to expurgate the
evil communication which may corrupt the good
manners of the house. A great watering-pot is
next advanced, and then a stern head&mdash;not unlike
an old medallion we have seen of Diogenes&mdash;looks
round the door-post after us.</p>

<p>The furnace, with its tall chimney, by means
of which the stove-pipes of the house we have
just visited, are heated, is at a considerable distance,
the pipes being carried under-ground to
the house.</p>

<p>We next go to look at the "Packing-house,"
where the powder is placed in barrels, bags, tin
cases, paper cases, canisters, &amp;c. On entering
this place, a man runs swiftly before each of us,
laying down a mat for each foot to step upon as
we advance, thus leaving rows of mats in our
wake, over which we are required to pass on returning.
We considered it a mark of great attention&mdash;a
kind of Oriental compliment.</p>

<p>The last of our visits is to a "Charge-House."
There are several of these, where the powder is
kept in store. We approach it by a path through
a plantation. It lies deep among the trees&mdash;a
most lonely, dismal sarcophagus. It is roofed
with water&mdash;that is, the roof is composed of water-tanks,
which are filled by the rain; and in
dry weather they are filled by means of a pump
arranged for that purpose. The platform at the
entrance is of water&mdash;that is to say, it is a broad
wooden trough two inches deep, full of water,
through which we are required to walk. We do
so, and with far more satisfaction than some
things we have done here to-day. We enter the
house alone; the others waiting outside. All
silent and dusky as an Egyptian tomb. The
tubs of powder, dimly seen in the uncertain
light, are ranged along the walls, like mummies&mdash;all
giving the impression of a secret life within.
But a secret life, how different! "Ah!
there's the rub." We retire with a mental
obeisance, and a respectful air&mdash;the influence
remaining with us, so that we bow slightly on
rejoining our friends outside, who bow in return,
looking from us to the open door-way of the
"house!"</p>

<p>With thoughtful brows, and not in any very
high state of hilarity, after the duties of the day&mdash;not
to speak of being wet through to the skin,
for the second time&mdash;we move through the fir
groves on our way back. We notice a strange
appearance in many trees, some of which are
curiously distorted, others with their heads cut
off; and, in some places, there are large and
upright gaps in a plantation. Mr. Ashbee, after
deliberating inwardly a little while, informs us
that a very dreadful accident happened here last
year. "Was there an explosion?" we inquire.
He says there was. "And a serious one?"&mdash;"Yes."&mdash;"Any
lives lost?"&mdash;"Yes."&mdash;"Two
or three?"&mdash;"More than that."&mdash;"Five or six?"
He says more than that. He gradually drops
into the narrative, with a subdued tone of voice.
There was an explosion last year. Six different
houses blew up. It began with a "Separating
House,"&mdash;a place for sizing, or sorting, the different
grains through sieves. Then the explosion
went to a "Granulating-House," one hundred
yards off. How it was carried such distances,
except by a general combustion of the
air, he can not imagine. Thence, it went to a
"Press House," where the powder lies in hard
cakes. Thence, it went in two ways&mdash;on one
side to a "Composition Mixing-House," and, on
the other, to a "Glazing-House;" and thence
to another "Granulating-House." Each of these
buildings were fully one hundred yards from another;
each was intercepted by plantations of
fir and forest trees as a protection; and the whole
took place within forty seconds. There was no
tracing how it had occurred.</p>

<p>This, then, accounts for the different gaps&mdash;some
of them extending fifty or sixty yards&mdash;in
the plantations and groves? Mr. Ashbee nods
a grave assent. He adds, that one large tree
was torn up by the roots, and its trunk was found
deposited at such a distance, that they never
could really ascertain where it came from. It
was just found lying there. An iron water-wheel,
of thirty feet in circumference, belonging
to one of the mills, was blown to a distance of
fifty yards through the air, cutting through the
heads of all the trees in its way, and finally
lodging between the upper boughs of a large tree,
where it stuck fast, like a boy's kite. The poor
fellows who were killed&mdash;(our informant here
drops his voice to a whisper, and speaks in short
detached fragments; there is nobody near us,
but he feels as a man should feel in speaking of
such things)&mdash;the poor fellows who were killed
were horribly mutilated&mdash;more than mutilated,
<a class="pagenum" id="page_647" title="pg 647"></a>
some of them&mdash;their different members distributed
hither and thither, could not be buried with
their proper owners, to any certainty. One man
escaped out of a house, before it blew up, in time
to run at least forty yards. He was seen running,
when suddenly he fell. But when he was
picked up, he was found to be quite dead. The
concussion of the air had killed him. One man
coming down the river in a boat was mutilated.
Some men who were missing, were never found&mdash;blown
all to nothing. The place where some
of the "houses" had stood, did not retain so
much as a piece of timber, or a brick. All had
been swept away, leaving nothing but the torn-up
ground, a little rubbish, and a black hash of
bits of stick, to show the place where they had
been erected.</p>

<p>We turn our eyes once more toward the immense
gaps in the fir groves, gaps which here
and there amount to wide intervals, in which all
the trees are reduced to about half their height,
having been cut away near the middle. Some
trees, near at hand, we observe to have been
flayed of their bark all down one side; others
have strips of bark hanging dry and black. Several
trees are strangely distorted, and the entire
trunk of one large fir has been literally twisted
like a corkscrew, from top to bottom, requiring
an amount of force scarcely to be estimated by
any known means of mechanical power. Amid
all this quietness, how dreadful a visitation! It
is visible on all sides, and fills the scene with a
solemn, melancholy weight.</p>

<p>But we will linger here no longer. We take
a parting glance around, at the plantations of
firs, some of them prematurely old, and shaking
their heads, while the air wafts by, as though
conscious of their defeated youth, and all its
once-bright hopes. The dead leaves lie thick
beneath, in various sombre colors of decay, and
through the thin bare woods we see the gray
light fading into the advancing evening. Here,
where the voice of man is never heard, we pause,
to listen to the sound of rustling boughs, and
the sullen rush and murmur of water-wheels and
mill-streams; and, over all, the song of a thrush,
even while uttering blithe notes, gives a touching
sadness to this isolated scene of human labors&mdash;labors,
the end of which, is a destruction
of numbers of our species, which may, or may
not, be necessary to the progress of civilization,
and the liberty of mankind.</p>

<h2 id="AN_INSANE_PHILOSOPHER">AN INSANE PHILOSOPHER.</h2>

<p class="drop">A visitor to the Hanwell Insane Asylum,
in England, will have his attention directed
to one of the inmates who is at once the "pet,"
the peer, the philosopher, and the poet of that
vast community. No one can long enjoy the privilege
of his company without perceiving that he
has received a first-rate classical education. His
mind is remarkably clear-visioned, acute, severe,
logical, and accomplished. His manners usually
display the refinement, polish, and urbanity of a
well-bred gentleman, though at times, it is said,
they are tinged with a degree of aristocratic pride,
austerity, and hauteur, especially when brought
into contact with the ignorant and vulgar. In
conversation, though impeded by a slight hesitation
of utterance, he displays clearness and
breadth of intelligence in all his views, and pours
forth freely from the treasures of a well-stored
memory abundance of information, anecdote, and
fact. His physiognomy and physical structure
are well adapted to enshrine a mind of such a
calibre. In stature he is tall, rather slender, but
firmly knit. The muscular development of the
frame denotes considerable strength&mdash;a quality
which he claims to possess in a pre-eminent degree.
He boasts, probably with considerable truth,
of having no equal, in this respect, in the asylum.
His head, beautifully formed, after a fine
intellectual type, is partially bald&mdash;the few surviving
locks of hair that fringe its sides being
nearly gray. The keen, twinkling, gray eye;
the prominent classic brow; the boldly-chiseled
aquiline nose; the thin cheeks, "sicklied o'er
with the pale cast of thought;" the sharp features,
together with the small, firmly-compressed
mouth, plainly bespeak him a man of reflection,
and strong purpose. In age, he appears to have
weathered about fifty stormy winters. The term of
his residence in this rendezvous of afflicted strangers
is somewhere about six years. His <i>real</i> name,
his early history, his human kindred, his former
social status&mdash;in fact, all the antecedents of his
life, previous to his admission to the asylum&mdash;are
utterly unknown. On all these matters he preserves
the silence of a sphinx. No remarks, so
far as we know, have ever escaped his lips, calculated
to afford any certain clew for the elucidation
of the mystery that enshrouds him. Surmise
and conjecture have of course been busy
with their guesses as to his probable extraction;
and the organ of wonder has been sorely taxed
in an effort to account for the marvelous fact, that
a gentleman of such apparent distinction, it may
be of noble birth and fortune, should have been
lost to his friends for a space of six years, and no
earnest inquiries been made to discover his fate.
That he is of aristocratic descent, appears to be
the general impression among the officers and inmates
of the asylum&mdash;an impression justified by
his elegant manners, his superior attainments, his
extensive acquaintance with noble families, and
many significant allusions found in his painted
chamber, upon the walls of which he has faithfully
daguerreotyped the images, the feelings, the
recollections, and the cherished sentiments of his
inner man. The <i>fictitious</i> name by which he is
known at present is that of Mr. Chiswick&mdash;a name
commemorative of the <i>scene</i> of that sad event
which has overshadowed the afternoon, and which
threatens to darken the evening, of his earthly
existence. But the reader will be anxious to
learn under what strange conjunction of circumstances
this mysterious being&mdash;without father or
mother, brothers or sisters, kinsfolk or acquaintances,
and without even a local habitation or a
name&mdash;obtained an introduction to this strange
home. We will at once state such facts as we
have been able to collect.
<a class="pagenum" id="page_648" title="pg 648"></a></p>

<p>On one Sabbath-day, about six years ago, a
congregation had gathered together, as was their
wont, for the celebration of divine worship, in the
small country church of Turnham Green, near
Chiswick. The officiating clergyman and the
worshiping assembly had jointly gone through
the liturgical services without the occurrence of
any unusual event. As soon as the robed minister
had ascended the sacred desk, and commenced
his discourse, however, the eyes of a portion
of the audience were attracted toward a gentleman
occupying a somewhat conspicuous position
in the church, whose strange and restless movements,
wild and excited air, and occasional audible
exclamations, indicated the presence of either
a fanatic or a lunatic. These symptoms continued
to increase, until, at length, as if irritated
beyond endurance by some sentiment that fell
from the lips of the preacher, he gave way to a
perfect paroxysm of frenzy, under the influence
of which he seized his hat, and flung it at the
head of the minister. Of course, the service was
suspended until the offender was expelled. It
was soon discovered that the unhappy author of
this untoward disturbance was suffering under a
violent fit of mania. When borne from the church,
no person could recognize or identify him. He
was a total stranger to all residing in the neighborhood,
so that no clew could be obtained that
would enable them to restore him to the custody
and surveillance of his friends. Under these circumstances,
he was taken to the adjoining work-house
at Isleworth, where he was detained for
some weeks under medical care, during which
period the most diligent inquiries were instituted
with the view of unraveling the mystery of the
stranger's kinship. But without avail. No one
claimed him; and even when pressed himself to
impart some information on the subject, he either
could not or would not divulge the secret. Finding,
at length, that all efforts to identify the great
Incognito were ineffectual, he was removed to
Hanwell, the asylum of the county to which he
had thus suddenly become chargeable, and where
he has ever since remained.</p>

<p>Mr. Chiswick is treated by the magistrates and
officers with great kindness and consideration.
His employments are such as befit a gentleman.
No menial or laborious tasks are imposed upon
him. He is allowed, to a great extent, to consult
his predilections, and these are invariably of
a tasteful and elegant description. His time is
divided chiefly between reading and painting, in
which occupations he is devotedly industrious.
He is an early riser, and intersperses his more
sedentary pursuits with seasons of vigorous exercise.
To this practice, in conjunction with
strictly temperate habits, he attributes his excellent
health and remarkable prowess. To a stranger,
no signs of mental aberration are discernible.
His aspect is so calm and collected, and his ideas
are so lucidly expressed, that, if met with in any
other place besides an asylum, no one would suspect
that he had ever been smitten with a calamity
so terrible. He would simply be regarded as
eccentric. So satisfied is he of his own perfect
saneness, and of his ability to secure self-maintenance
by the productions of his own genius,
that confinement begins to be felt by him as intolerably
irksome and oppressive. The invisible
fetters gall his sensitive soul, and render him
impatient of restraint. On our last visit but one,
he declared that he had abandoned all thoughts
of doing any thing more to his painted room; he
aspired to higher things than that. He was
striving to cultivate his artistic talents, so that
by their exercise he might henceforth minister
to his own necessities. Who his connections,
and what his antecedents were should never be
known&mdash;they were things that concerned no one;
his aim was to qualify himself, by self-reliant
labor, to wrestle once more with the world, and
to wring from it the pittance of a humble subsistence.
As soon as he felt himself competent
to hazard this step, he intended to demand his
immediate release; "and, should it then be refused,"
said he, with the solemn and impressive
emphasis of a man thoroughly in earnest, "they
will, on the next day, find me a <i>corpse</i>." To
the superintendent in the tailoring department,
he likewise remarked, a short time since, when
giving instructions for a new garment: "This
is the last favor I shall ever ask of you. I intend
shortly to quit the asylum; for if they do
not discharge me of their own accord, in answer
to my request, <i>I will discharge myself</i>."</p>

<p>On the occasion of our second visit to the
asylum, we were received by Mr. Chiswick with
great courtesy, and were favored with a long
conversation on a variety of topics. Besides the
exercise of his brush and pencil, his genius manifests
itself in other ways, some of them being
rather amusing and eccentric. Among these, is
that of making stockings, and other articles of
apparel in a very original manner. His mind,
as we have remarked, is well replenished with
anecdotes and illustrations suitable to whatever
topic may happen to be on hand. On the present
occasion, upon offering us a glass of wine,
we declined his hospitality, on the true plea that
we had fasted since eight o'clock in the morning,
and it was then nearly five in the afternoon.
Upon this, he produced a piece of sweet bread,
saying, "Take that first, and then the wine will
not hurt you. You remember the anecdote of
the bride? Soon after her marriage, her mother
inquired,'How does your husband treat you, my
dear?' Oh, he loves me very much, for he
gives me two glasses of white wine every morning
before I am up.' 'My dear child,' said the
mother, with an air of alarm, 'he means to kill
you. However, do not refuse the wine, but take
a piece of cake to bed with you at night, and
when he is gone for the wine in the morning, do
you eat the cake, then the wine will not hurt
you,' The bride obeyed the mother's advice,
and lived to a good old age."</p>

<p>Having sat down by the fire in the ward with
a number of the patients, Mr. Chiswick took out
his pocket-book to show us a letter which he
had received from some kind but unknown friend,
who had visited the asylum, and also that he
<a class="pagenum" id="page_649" title="pg 649"></a>
might present to us a piece of poetry, which had
just been printed at the asylum press. In looking
for these, he accidentally dropped a greater
part of the contents of his pocket-book on the
floor; and when one of the lunatics hastened to
scramble for some of the papers, Mr. Chiswick,
quick as thought, pulled off the officious patient's
hat, and sent it flying to the other end of the
ward, bidding its owner to run after it. We offered
to assist in picking up the scattered papers,
but he would not allow us to touch them. "You
act," we remarked, "on the principle of not allowing
others to do for you any thing that you
can do yourself." "Exactly so," said he, "and
I will tell you a good anecdote about that. There
was once a bishop of Gibraltar, who hired a valet;
but for some time this valet had nothing to do:
the bishop cleaned his own boots, and performed
many other menial tasks, which the servant supposed
that he had been engaged to do. At length
he said&mdash;'Your lordship, I should be glad to be
informed what it is expected that I should do.
You clean your own boots, brush your own
clothes, and do a multitude of other things that
I supposed would fall to my lot.' 'Well,' said
the bishop, 'I have been accustomed to do this,
and I can do it very well; therefore, why should
you do it? I act upon the principle of never allowing
others to do what I can do myself. Therefore,
do you go and study, and I will go on as
usual. I have already had opportunities to get
knowledge, and you have not; and I think that will
be to do to you as I should wish you to do to me.'"</p>

<p class="drop">London. Michaelmas Term lately over, and
the Lord Chancellor sitting in Lincoln's Inn

mud in the streets, as if the water had but newly
retired from the face of the earth, and it would
not be wonderful to meet a Megalosaurus, forty
feet long or so, waddling like an elephantine lizard
up Holborn hill. Smoke lowering down from

flakes of soot in it as big as full-grown snow-flakes&mdash;gone
into mourning, one might imagine, for the
death of the sun. Dogs, undistinguishable in
mire. Horses scarcely better; splashed to their
very blinkers. Foot passengers, jostling one another's
umbrellas, in a general infection of ill-temper,
and losing their foot-hold at street-corners,
where tens of thousands of other foot passengers
have been slipping and sliding since the day broke
(if the day ever broke), adding new deposits to the
crust upon crust of mud, sticking at those points
tenaciously to the pavement, and accumulating
at compound interest.</p>

<p>Fog everywhere. Fog up the river, where it
flows among green aits and meadows; fog down
the river, where it rolls defiled among the tiers of
shipping, and the waterside pollutions of a great
(and dirty) city. Fog on the Essex marshes, fog
on the Kentish heights. Fog creeping into the
cabooses of collier-brigs; fog lying out on the
yards, and hovering in the rigging of great ships;
fog drooping on the gunwales of barges and small
boats. Fog in the eyes and throats of ancient
Greenwich pensioners, wheezing by the firesides
of their wards; fog in the stem and bowl of the
afternoon pipe of the wrathful skipper, down in
his close cabin; fog cruelly pinching the toes and
fingers of his shivering little 'prentice boy on deck.
Chance people on the bridges peeping over the
parapets into a nether sky of fog, with fog all
round them, as if they were up in a balloon, and
hanging in the misty clouds.</p>

<p>Gas looming through the fog in divers places
in the streets, much as the sun may, from the
spongy fields, be seen to loom by husbandman
and plow-boy. Most of the shops lighted two
hours before their time&mdash;as the gas seems to know,
for it has a haggard and unwilling look.</p>

<p>The raw afternoon is rawest, and the dense fog
is densest, and the muddy streets are muddiest,
near that leaden-headed old obstruction, appropriate
ornament for the threshold of a leaden-headed
old corporation: Temple Bar. And hard
by Temple Bar, in Lincoln's Inn Hall, at the very
heart of the fog, sits the Lord High Chancellor in
his High Court of Chancery.</p>

<p>
ever can there come fog too thick, never can
there come mud and mire too deep, to assort with
the groping and floundering condition which this
High Court of Chancery, most pestilent of hoary
sinners, holds, this day, in the sight of heaven
and earth.</p>

<p>On such an afternoon, if ever, the Lord High
Chancellor ought to be sitting here&mdash;as here he is&mdash;with
a foggy glory round his head, softly fenced
in with crimson cloth and curtains, addressed by
a large advocate with great whiskers, a little
voice, and an interminable brief, and outwardly
directing his contemplation to the lantern in the
roof, where he can see nothing but fog. On such
an afternoon, some score of members of the High
Court of Chancery bar ought to be&mdash;as here they
are&mdash;mistily engaged in one of the ten thousand
stages of an endless cause, tripping one another
up on slippery precedents, groping knee-deep in
technicalities, running their goat-hair and horse-hair
warded heads against walls of words, and
making a pretense of equity with serious faces, as
players might. On such an afternoon, the various
solicitors in the cause, some two or three of whom
have inherited it from their fathers, who made a
fortune by it, ought to be&mdash;as are they not?&mdash;ranged
in a line, in a long matted well (but you
might look in vain for Truth at the bottom of it),
between the registrar's red table and the silk
gowns, with bills, cross-bills, answers, rejoinders,
injunctions, affidavits, issues, references to masters,
masters' reports, mountains of costly nonsense,
piled before them. Well may the court be
dim, with wasting candles here and there; well
may the fog hang heavy in it, as if it would never
get out; well may the stained glass windows lose
their color, and admit no light of day into the
place; well may the uninitiated from the streets,
<a class="pagenum" id="page_650" title="pg 650"></a>
who peep in through the glass panes in the door,
be deterred from entrance by its owlish aspect,
and by the drawl languidly echoing to the roof
from the padded dais where the Lord High Chancellor
looks into the lantern that has no light in
it, and where the attendant wigs are all stuck in
a fog-bank! This is the Court of Chancery;
which has its decaying houses and its blighted
lands in every shire; which has its worn-out
lunatic in every mad-house, and its dead in every
church-yard; which has its ruined suitor, with his
slipshod heels and threadbare dress, borrowing
and begging through the round of every man's
acquaintance; which gives to moneyed might the
means abundantly of wearying out the right;
which so exhausts finances, patience, courage,
hope; so overthrows the brain and breaks the
heart; that there is not an honorable man among
its practitioners who would not give&mdash;who does
not often give&mdash;the warning, "Suffer any wrong
that can be done you, rather than come here!"</p>

<p>Who happen to be in the Lord Chancellor's
court this murky afternoon besides the Lord
Chancellor, the counsel in the cause, two or
three counsel who are never in any cause, and
the well of solicitors before mentioned? There
is the registrar below the Judge, in wig and gown;
and there are two or three maces, or petty-bags,
or privy-purses, or whatever they may be, in legal
court suits. These are all yawning; for no crumb
of amusement ever falls from <span class="smcap">Jarndyce and
Jarndyce</span> (the cause in hand) which was squeezed
dry years upon years ago. The short-hand
writers, the reporters of the court, and the reporters
of the newspapers, invariably decamp with
the rest of the regulars when Jarndyce and Jarndyce
comes on. Their places are a blank. Standing
on a seat at the side of the hall, the better to
peer into the curtained sanctuary, is a little mad
old woman in a squeezed bonnet, who is always
in court, from its sitting to its rising, and always
expecting some incomprehensible judgment to be
given in her favor. Some say she really is, or
was, a party to a suit; but no one knows for
certain, because no one cares. She carries some
small litter in a reticule which she calls her documents;
principally consisting of paper matches
and dry lavender. A sallow prisoner has come
up, in custody, for the half-dozenth time, to make
a personal application "to purge himself of his
contempt;" which, being a solitary surviving executor
who has fallen into a state of conglomeration
about accounts of which it is not pretended
that he had ever any knowledge, he is not at all
likely ever to do. In the meantime, his prospects
in life are ended. Another ruined suitor, who
periodically appears from Shropshire, and breaks
out into efforts to address the Chancellor at the
close of the day's business, and who can by no
means be made to understand that the Chancellor
is legally ignorant of his existence after making
it desolate for a quarter of a century, plants himself
in a good place and keeps an eye on the
Judge, ready to call out "My lord!" in a voice
of sonorous complaint, on the instant of his rising.
A few lawyers' clerks and others who know
this suitor by sight, linger, on the chance of his
furnishing some fun, and enlivening the dismal
weather a little.</p>

<p>Jarndyce and Jarndyce drones on. This scare-crow
of a suit has, in course of time, become so
complicated, that no man alive knows what it
means. The parties to it understand it least;
but it has been observed that no two Chancery
lawyers can talk about it for five minutes, without
coming to a total disagreement as to all the premises.
Innumerable children have been born into
the cause; innumerable young people have married
into it; innumerable old people have died out
of it. Scores of persons have deliriously found
themselves made parties in Jarndyce and Jarndyce,
without knowing how or why; whole families
have inherited legendary hatreds with the
suit. The little plaintiff or defendant, who was
promised a new rocking-horse when Jarndyce and
Jarndyce should be settled, has grown up, possessed
himself of a real horse, and trotted away
into the other world. Fair wards of court have
faded into mothers and grandmothers; a long procession
of Chancellors has come in and gone out;
the legion of bills in the suit have been transformed
into mere bills of mortality; there are not
three Jarndyces left upon the earth perhaps, since
old Tom Jarndyce in despair blew his brains out
at a coffee-house in Chancery-lane; but Jarndyce
and Jarndyce still drags its dreary length before
the Court, perennially hopeless.</p>

<p>Jarndyce and Jarndyce has passed into a joke.
That is the only good that has ever come of it.
It has been death to many, but it is a joke in the
profession. Every master in Chancery has had
a reference out of it. Every Chancellor was "in
it," for somebody or other, when he was counsel
at the bar. Good things have been said about it
by blue-nosed, bulbous-shoed old benchers, in
select port-wine committee after dinner in hall.
Articled clerks have been in the habit of fleshing
their legal wit upon it. The last Lord Chancellor
handled it neatly, when, correcting Mr. Blowers
the eminent silk gown who said that such a
thing might happen when the sky rained potatoes,
he observed, "or when we get through Jarndyce
and Jarndyce, Mr. Blowers;"&mdash;a pleasantry that
particularly tickled the maces, bags, and purses.</p>

<p>How many people out of the suit, Jarndyce and
Jarndyce has stretched forth its unwholesome
hand to spoil and corrupt, would be a very wide
question. From the master, upon whose impaling
files reams of dusty warrants in Jarndyce and
Jarndyce have grimly writhed into many shapes;
down to the copying clerk in the Six Clerks' Office,
who has copied his tens of thousands of Chancery-folio-pages
under that eternal heading; no man's
nature has been made the better by it. In trickery,
evasion, procrastination, spoliation, botheration,
under false pretenses of all sorts, there are
influences that can never come to good. The
very solicitors' boys who have kept the wretched
suitors at bay, by protesting time out of mind that
Mr. Chizzle, Mizzle, or otherwise, was particularly
<a class="pagenum" id="page_651" title="pg 651"></a>
engaged and had appointments until dinner, may
have got an extra moral twist and shuffle into
themselves out of Jarndyce and Jarndyce. The
receiver in the cause has acquired a goodly sum
of money by it, but has acquired too a distrust of
his own mother, and a contempt for his own kind.
Chizzle, Mizzle, and otherwise, have lapsed into
a habit of vaguely promising themselves that
they will look into that outstanding little matter,
and see what can be done for Drizzle&mdash;who was
not well used&mdash;when Jarndyce and Jarndyce
shall be got out of the office. Shirking and sharking,
in all their many varieties, have been sown
broadcast by the ill-fated cause; and even those
who have contemplated its history from the outermost
circle of such evil, have been insensibly
tempted into a loose way of letting bad things
alone to take their own bad course, and a loose
belief that if the world go wrong, it was, in some
off-hand manner, never meant to go right.</p>

<p>Thus, in the midst of the mud and at the heart
of the fog, sits the Lord High Chancellor in his
High Court of Chancery.</p>

<p>"Mr. Tangle," says the Lord High Chancellor,
latterly something restless under the eloquence
of that learned gentleman.</p>

<p>"Mlud," says Mr. Tangle. Mr. Tangle knows
more of Jarndyce and Jarndyce than any body.
He is famous for it&mdash;supposed never to have read
any thing else since he left school.</p>

<p>"Have you nearly concluded your argument?"</p>

<p>"Mlud, no&mdash;variety of points&mdash;feel it my duty
tsubmit&mdash;ludship," is the reply that slides out
of Mr. Tangle.</p>

<p>"Several members of the bar are still to be
heard, I believe?" says the Chancellor, with a
slight smile.</p>

<p>Eighteen of Mr. Tangle's learned friends, each
armed with a little summary of eighteen hundred
sheets, bob up like eighteen hammers in a piano-forte,
make eighteen bows, and drop into their
eighteen places of obscurity.</p>

<p>"We will proceed with the hearing on Wednesday
fortnight," says the Chancellor. For, the
question at issue is only a question of costs, a
mere bud on the forest tree of the parent suit, and
really will come to a settlement one of these days.</p>

<p>The Chancellor rises; the bar rises; the prisoner
is brought forward in a hurry; the man from
Shropshire cries, "My lord!" Maces, bags, and
purses, indignantly proclaim silence, and frown
at the man from Shropshire.</p>

<p>"In reference," proceeds the Chancellor, "still on
Jarndyce and Jarndyce, to the young girl&mdash;&mdash;."</p>

<p>"Begludship's pardon&mdash;boy," says Mr. Tangle,
prematurely.</p>

<p>"In reference," proceeds the Chancellor, with
extra distinctness, "to the young girl and boy,
the two young people."</p>

<p>(Mr. Tangle crushed.)</p>

<p>"Whom I directed to be in attendance to-day,
and who are now in my private room, I will see
them and satisfy myself as to the expediency of
making the order for their residing with their
uncle."</p>

<p>Mr. Tangle on his legs again.</p>

<p>"Begludship's pardon&mdash;dead."</p>

<p>"With their," Chancellor looking through his
double eye-glass at the papers on his desk,
"grandfather."</p>

<p>"Begludship's pardon&mdash;victim of rash action&mdash;brains."</p>

<p>Suddenly a very little counsel, with a terrific
bass voice, arises, fully inflated, in the back settlements
of the fog, and says, "Will your lordship
allow me? I appear for him. He is a cousin,
several times removed. I am not at the moment
prepared to inform the Court in what exact remove
he is a cousin; but he <i>is</i> a cousin."</p>

<p>Leaving this address (delivered like a sepulchral
message) ringing in the rafters of the roof, the
very little counsel drops, and the fog knows him
no more. Every body looks for him. Nobody
can see him.</p>

<p>"I will speak with both the young people," says
the Chancellor anew, "and satisfy myself on the
subject of their residing with their cousin. I will
mention the matter to-morrow morning when I
take my seat."</p>

<p>The Chancellor is about to bow to the bar, when
the prisoner is presented. Nothing can possibly
come of the prisoner's conglomeration, but his being
sent back to prison; which is soon done. The
man from Shropshire ventures another remonstrative
"My lord!" but the Chancellor, being aware
of him, has dexterously vanished. Every body
else quickly vanishes too. A battery of blue bags
is loaded with heavy charges of papers and carried
off by clerks; the little mad old woman
marches off with her documents; the empty
court is locked up. If all the injustice it has
committed, and all the misery it has caused,
could only be locked up with it, and the whole
burnt away in a great funeral pyre&mdash;why, so
much the better for other parties than the parties
in Jarndyce and Jarndyce!</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.&mdash;<span class="smcap">In Fashion.</span></h3>

<p>It is but a glimpse of the world of fashion that
we want on this same miry afternoon. It is not
so unlike the Court of Chancery, but that we may
pass from the one scene to the other, as the crow
flies. Both the world of fashion and the Court
of Chancery are things of precedent and usage;
over-sleeping Rip Van Winkles, who have played
at strange games through a deal of thundery
weather; sleeping beauties, whom the Knight
will wake one day, when all the stopped spits in
the kitchen shall begin to turn prodigiously.</p>

<p>It is not a large world. Relatively even to
this world of ours, which has its limits too (as
your Highness shall find when you have made the
tour of it, and are come to the brink of the void
beyond), it is a very little speck. There is much
good in it; there are many good and true people
in it; it has its appointed place. But the evil of
it is, that it is a world wrapped up in too much
jeweler's cotton and fine wool, and can not hear
the rushing of the larger worlds, and can not see
them as they circle round the sun. It is a deadened
<a class="pagenum" id="page_652" title="pg 652"></a>
world, and its growth is sometimes unhealthy
for want of air.</p>

<p>My Lady Dedlock has returned to her house in
town for a few days previous to her departure for
Paris, where her ladyship intends to stay some
weeks; after which her movements are uncertain.
The fashionable intelligence says so, for the comfort
of the Parisians, and it knows all fashionable things.
To know things otherwise, were to be unfashionable.
My Lady Dedlock has been down at what she calls,
in familiar conversation, her "place" in Lincolnshire.
The waters are out in Lincolnshire. An
arch of the bridge in the park has been sapped
and sopped away. The adjacent low-lying ground,
for half a mile in breadth, is a stagnant river, with
melancholy trees for islands in it, and a surface
punctured all over, all day long, with falling rain.
My Lady Dedlock's "place" has been extremely
dreary. The weather, for many a day and night,
has been so wet that the trees seem wet through,
and the soft loppings and prunings of the woodman's
ax can make no crash or crackle as they
fall. The deer, looking soaked, leave quagmires,
where they pass. The shot of a rifle loses its
sharpness in the moist air, and its smoke moves
in a tardy little cloud toward the green rise, coppice-topped,
that makes a back-ground for the falling
rain. The view from my Lady Dedlock's own
windows is alternately a lead-colored view, and
a view in Indian ink. The vases on the stone
terrace in the foreground catch the rain all day;
and the heavy drops fall, drip, drip, drip, upon
the broad flagged pavement, called, from old
time, the Ghost's Walk, all night. On Sundays,
the little church in the park is mouldy; the oaken
pulpit breaks out into a cold sweat; and there is a
general smell and taste as of the ancient Dedlocks
in their graves. My Lady Dedlock (who is child-less),
looking out in the early twilight from her
boudoir at a keeper's lodge, and seeing the light
of a fire upon the latticed panes, and smoke rising
from the chimney, and a child, chased by a
woman, running out into the rain to meet the
shining figure of a wrapped-up man coming
through the gate, has been put quite out of temper.
My Lady Dedlock says she has been "bored to
death."</p>

<p>Therefore my Lady Dedlock has come away
from the place in Lincolnshire, and has left it to
the rain, and the crows, and the rabbits, and the
deer, and the partridges, and pheasants. The
pictures of the Dedlocks past and gone seemed to
vanish into the damp walls in mere lowness of
spirits, as the housekeeper has passed along the
old rooms, shutting up the shutters. And when
they will next come forth again, the fashionable
intelligence&mdash;which, like the fiend, is omniscient
of the past and present, but not the future&mdash;can
not yet undertake to say.</p>

<p>Sir Leicester Dedlock is only a baronet, but
there is no mightier baronet than he. His family
is as old as the hills, and infinitely more respectable.
He has a general opinion that the world
might get on without hills, but would be done up
without Dedlocks. He would on the whole admit
Nature to be a good idea (a little low, perhaps,
when not inclosed with a park-fence), but
an idea dependent for its execution on your great
county families. He is a gentleman of strict
conscience, disdainful of all littleness and meanness,
and ready, on the shortest notice, to die any
death you may please to mention rather than
give occasion for the least impeachment of his
integrity. He is an honorable, obstinate, truthful,
high-spirited, intensely prejudiced, perfectly
unreasonable man.</p>

<p>Sir Leicester is twenty years, full measure,
older than my Lady. He will never see sixty-five
again, nor perhaps sixty-six, nor yet sixty-seven.
He has a twist of the gout now and then,
and walks a little stiffly. He is of a worthy presence,
with his light gray hair and whiskers, his
fine shirt-frill, his pure white waistcoat, and his
blue coat with bright buttons always buttoned.
He is ceremonious, stately, most polite on every
occasion to my Lady, and holds her personal attractions
in the highest estimation. His gallantry
to my Lady, which has never changed since he
courted her, is the one little touch of romantic
fancy in him.</p>

<p>Indeed, he married her for love. A whisper
still goes about, that she had not even family;
howbeit, Sir Leicester had so much family that
perhaps he had enough, and could dispense with
any more. But she had beauty, pride, ambition,
insolent resolve, and sense enough to portion out
a legion of fine ladies. Wealth and station, added
to these, soon floated her upward; and for years,
now, my Lady Dedlock has been at the centre
of the fashionable intelligence, and at the top of
the fashionable tree.</p>

<p>How Alexander wept, when he had no more
worlds to conquer, every body knows&mdash;or has
some reason to know by this time, the matter
having been rather frequently mentioned. My
Lady Dedlock, having conquered <i>her</i> world, fell,
not into the melting but rather into the freezing
mood. An exhausted composure, a worn-out
placidity, an equanimity of fatigue, not to be
ruffled by interest or satisfaction, are the trophies
of her victory. She is perfectly well bred. If
she could be translated to Heaven to-morrow,
she might be expected to ascend without any
rapture.</p>

<p>She has beauty still, and, if it be not in its
heyday, it is not yet in its autumn. She has a
fine face&mdash;originally of a character that would be
rather called very pretty than handsome, but improved
into classicality by the acquired expression
of her fashionable state. Her figure is elegant,
and has the effect of being tall. Not that
she is so, but that "the most is made," as the
Honorable Bob Staples has frequently asserted
upon oath, "of all her points." The same authority
observes, that she is perfectly got up
and remarks, in commendation of her hair especially,
that she is the best-groomed woman in the
whole stud.</p>

<p>With all her perfections on her head, my Lady
Dedlock has come up from her place in Lincolnshire
<a class="pagenum" id="page_653" title="pg 653"></a>
(hotly pursued by the fashionable intelligence),
to pass a few days at her house in town
previous to her departure for Paris, where her
ladyship intends to stay some weeks, after which
her movements are uncertain. And at her house
in town, upon this muddy, murky afternoon, presents
himself an old-fashioned old gentleman,
attorney-at-law, and eke solicitor of the High
Court of Chancery, who has the honor of acting
as legal adviser of the Dedlocks, and has as
many cast-iron boxes in his office with that name
outside, as if the present baronet were the coin
of the conjuror's trick, and were constantly being
juggled through the whole set. Across the hall,
and up the stairs, and along the passages, and
through the rooms, which are very brilliant in
the season and very dismal out of it&mdash;Fairy-land
to visit, but a desert to live in&mdash;the old gentleman
is conducted, by a Mercury in powder, to
my Lady's presence.</p>

<p>The old gentleman is rusty to look at, but is
reputed to have made good thrift out of aristocratic
marriage settlements and aristocratic wills,
and to be very rich. He is surrounded by a mysterious
halo of family confidences; of which he
is known to be the silent depository. There are
noble Mausoleums rooted for centuries in retired
glades of parks, among the growing timber and
the fern, which perhaps hold fewer noble secrets
than walk abroad among men, shut up in the
breast of Mr. Tulkinghorn. He is of what is
called the old school&mdash;a phrase generally meaning
any school that seems never to have been young&mdash;and
wears knee breeches tied with ribbons, and
gaiters or stockings. One peculiarity of his black
clothes, and of his black stockings, be they silk
or worsted, is, that they never shine. Mute,
close, irresponsive to any glancing light, his dress
is like himself. He never converses, when not
professionally consulted. He is found sometimes,
speechless but quite at home, at corners of dinner-tables
in great country houses, and near doors
of drawing-rooms, concerning which the fashionable
intelligence is eloquent: where every body
knows him, and where half the Peerage stops to
say "How do you do, Mr. Tulkinghorn?" He receives
these salutations with gravity, and buries
them along with the rest of his knowledge.</p>

<p>Sir Leicester Dedlock is with my Lady, and is
happy to see Mr. Tulkinghorn. There is an air
of prescription about him which is always agreeable
to Sir Leicester; he receives it as a kind of
tribute. He likes Mr. Tulkinghorn's dress; there
is a kind of tribute in that too. It is eminently
respectable, and likewise, in a general way, retainer-like.
It expresses, as it were, the steward
of the legal mysteries, the butler of the legal cellar
of the Dedlocks.</p>

<p>Has Mr. Tulkinghorn any idea of this himself?
It may be so, or it may not; but there is this remarkable
circumstance to be noted in every thing
associated with my Lady Dedlock as one of a
class&mdash;as one of the leaders and representatives
of her little world. She supposes herself to be an
inscrutable Being, quite out of the reach and ken
of ordinary mortals&mdash;seeing herself in her glass,
where indeed she looks so. Yet, every dim little
star revolving about her, from her maid to the
manager of the Italian Opera, knows her weaknesses,
prejudices, follies, haughtinesses, and
caprices; and lives upon as accurate a calculation
and as nice a measure of her moral nature,
as her dress-maker takes of her physical proportions.
Is a new dress, a new custom, a new
singer, a new dancer, a new form of jewelry, a
new dwarf or giant, a new chapel, a new any
thing, to be set up? There are deferential people,
in a dozen callings, whom my Lady Dedlock
suspects of nothing but prostration before her,
who can tell you how to manage her as if she
were a baby; who do nothing but nurse her all
their lives; who, humbly affecting to follow with
profound subservience, lead her and her whole
troop after them; who, in hooking one, hook all
and bear them off, as Lemuel Gulliver bore away
the stately fleet of the majestic Lilliput. "If
you want to address our people, sir," say Blaze
and Sparkle the jewelers&mdash;meaning by our people,
Lady Dedlock and the rest&mdash;"you must remember
that you are not dealing with the general
public; you must hit our people in their weakest
place, and their weakest place is such a place."
"To make this article go down, gentlemen,"
say Sheen and Gloss the mercers, to their friends
the manufacturers, "you must come to us, because
we know where to have the fashionable
people, and we can make it fashionable." "If
you want to get this print upon the tables of my
high connection, sir," says Mr. Sladdery the
librarian, "or if you want to get this dwarf or
giant into the houses of my high connection, sir,
or if you want to secure to this entertainment the
patronage of my high connection, sir, you must
leave it, if you please, to me; for I have been
accustomed to study the leaders of my high connection,
sir; and I may tell you, without vanity,
that I can turn them round my finger"&mdash;in which
Mr. Sladdery, who is an honest man, does not
exaggerate at all.</p>

<p>"Therefore, while Mr. Tulkinghorn may not
know what was passing in the Dedlock mind at
present, it is very possible that he may.</p>

<p>"My Lady's cause has been again before the
Chancellor, has it, Mr. Tulkinghorn?" says Sir
Leicester, giving him his hand.</p>

<p>"Yes. It has been on again to-day," Mr.
Tulkinghorn replies; making one of his quiet bows
to my Lady, who is on a sofa near the fire, shading
her face with a hand-screen.</p>

<p>"It would be useless to ask," says my Lady,
with the dreariness of the place in Lincolnshire
still upon her, "whether any thing his been
done."</p>

<p>"Nothing that <i>you</i> would call any thing has
been done to-day," replies Mr. Tulkinghorn.</p>

<p>"Nor ever will be," says my Lady.</p>

<p>Sir Leicester has no objection to an interminable
Chancery suit. It is a slow, expensive, British,
constitutional kind of thing. To be sure, he
has not a vital interest in the suit in question, her
<a class="pagenum" id="page_654" title="pg 654"></a>
part in which was the only property my Lady
brought him; and he has a shadowy impression
that for his name&mdash;the name of Dedlock&mdash;to be in
a cause, and not in the title of that cause, is a most
ridiculous accident. But he regards the Court of
Chancery, even if it should involve an occasional
delay of justice and a trifling amount of confusion,
as a something, devised in conjunction with
a variety of other somethings, by the perfection of
human wisdom, for the eternal settlement (humanly
speaking) of every thing. And he is, upon
the whole, of a fixed opinion, that to give the
sanction of his countenance to any complaints respecting
it, would be to encourage some person of
the lower orders to rise up somewhere&mdash;like Wat
Tyler.</p>

<p>"As a few fresh affidavits have been put upon
the file," says Mr. Tulkinghorn, "and as they are
short, and as I proceed upon the troublesome
principle of begging leave to possess my clients
with any new proceedings in a cause;" cautious
man, Mr. Tulkinghorn, taking no more responsibility
than necessary; "and further, as I see you
are going to Paris, I have brought them in my
pocket."</p>

<p>(Sir Leicester was going to Paris too, by-the-by,
but the delight of the fashionable intelligence
was in his Lady.)</p>

<p>Mr. Tulkinghorn takes out his papers, asks permission
to place them on a golden talisman of a
table at my Lady's elbow, puts on his spectacles,
and begins to read by the light of a shaded lamp.</p>

<p>"'In Chancery. Between John Jarndyce&mdash;'"</p>

<p>My Lady interrupts him, requesting him to miss
as many of the formal horrors as he can.</p>

<p>Mr. Tulkinghorn glances over his spectacles,
and begins again lower down. My Lady carelessly
and scornfully abstracts her attention. Sir
Leicester in a great chair looks at the fire, and
appears to have a stately liking for the legal repetitions
and prolixities, as ranging among the national
bulwarks. It happens that the fire is hot,
where my Lady sits; and that the hand-screen is
more beautiful than useful, being priceless, but
small. My Lady, changing her position, sees the
papers on the table&mdash;looks at them nearer&mdash;looks
at them nearer still&mdash;asks impulsively:</p>

<p>"Who copied that?"</p>

<p>Mr. Tulkinghorn stops short, surprised at my
Lady's animation and her unusual tone.</p>

<p>"Is it what you people call law hand?" she
asks, looking full at him in her careless way again,
and toying with her screen.</p>

<p>"Not quite. Probably"&mdash;Mr. Tulkinghorn examines
it as he speaks&mdash;"the legal character it
has, was acquired after the original hand was
formed. Why do you ask?"</p>

<p>"Any thing to vary this detestable monotony.
O, go on, do!"</p>

<p>Mr. Tulkinghorn reads again. The heat is
greater; my Lady screens her face. Sir Leicester
dozes, starts up suddenly, and cries, "Eh? what
do you say?"</p>

<p>"I say I am afraid," says Mr. Tulkinghorn,
who has risen hastily, "that Lady Dedlock is ill."</p>

<p>"Faint," my Lady murmurs, with white lips,
"only that; but it is like the faintness of death.
Don't speak to me. Ring, and take me to my
room!"</p>

<p>Mr. Tulkinghorn retires into another chamber;
bells ring, feet shuffle and patter, silence ensues.
Mercury at last begs Mr. Tulkinghorn to return.</p>

<p>"Better now," quoth Sir Leicester, motioning
the lawyer to sit down and read to him alone.
"I have been quite alarmed. I never knew my
lady swoon before. But the weather is extremely
trying&mdash;and she really has been bored to death
down at our place in Lincolnshire."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.&mdash;<span class="smcap">A Progress.</span></h3>

<p>I have a great deal of difficulty in beginning
to write my portion of these pages, for I know I
am not clever. I always knew that. I can remember,
when I was a very little girl indeed, I
used to say to my doll, when we were alone together,
"Now, Dolly, I am not clever, you know
very well, and you must be patient with me, like
a dear!" And so she used to sit propped up in
a great arm-chair, with her beautiful complexion
and rosy lips, staring at me&mdash;or not so much at
me, I think, as at nothing&mdash;while I busily stitched
away, and told her every one of my secrets.</p>

<p>My dear old doll! I was such a shy little
thing that I seldom dared to open my lips, and
never dared to open my heart, to any body else.
It almost makes me cry to think what a relief it
used to be to me, when I came home from school
of a day, to run up stairs to my room, and say,
"O you dear faithful Dolly, I knew you would
be expecting me!" and then to sit down on the
floor, leaning on the elbow of her great chair, and
tell her all I had noticed since we parted. I had
always rather a noticing way&mdash;not a quick way,
O no!&mdash;a silent way of noticing what passed before
me, and thinking I should like to understand
it better. I have not by any means a quick understanding.
When I love a person very tenderly
indeed, it seems to brighten. But even that may
be my vanity.</p>

<p>I was brought up, from my earliest remembrance&mdash;like
some of the princesses in the fairy
stories, only I was not charming&mdash;by my godmother.
At least I only knew her as such. She
was a good, good woman! She went to church
three times every Sunday, and to morning prayers
on Wednesdays and Fridays, and to lectures
whenever there were lectures; and never missed.
She was handsome; and if she had ever smiled,
would have been (I used to think) like an angel&mdash;but
she never smiled. She was always grave,
and strict. She was so very good herself, I
thought, that the badness of other people made
her frown all her life. I felt so different from
her, even making every allowance for the differences
between a child and a woman; I felt so
poor, so trifling, and so far off; that I never could
be unrestrained with her&mdash;no, could never even
love her as I wished. It made me very sorry to
consider how good she was, and how unworthy
of her I was; and I used ardently to hope that I
<a class="pagenum" id="page_655" title="pg 655"></a>
might have a better heart; and I talked it over
very often with the dear old doll; but I never
loved my godmother as I ought to have loved
her, and as I felt I must have loved her if I had
been a better girl.</p>

<p>This made me, I dare say, more timid and
retiring than I naturally was, and cast me upon
Dolly as the only friend with whom I felt at ease.
But something happened when I was still quite
a little thing, that helped it very much.</p>

<p>I had never heard my mamma spoken of. I
had never heard of my papa either, but I felt
more interested about my mamma. I had never
worn a black frock, that I could recollect. I had
never been shown my mamma's grave. I had
never been told where it was. Yet I had never
been taught to pray for any relation but my godmother.
I had more than once approached this
subject of my thoughts with Mrs. Rachael, our
only servant, who took my light away when I
was in bed (another very good woman, but austere
to me), and she had only said, "Esther,
good-night!" and gone away and left me.</p>

<p>Although there were seven girls at the neighboring
school where I was a day boarder, and
although they called me little Esther Summerson,
I knew none of them at home. All of them
were older than I, to be sure (I was the youngest
there by a good deal), but there seemed to be
some other separation between us besides that,
and besides their being far more clever than I
was, and knowing much more than I did. One of
them, in the first week of my going to the school
(I remember it very well), invited me home to a
little party, to my great joy. But my godmother
wrote a stiff letter declining for me, and I never
went. I never went out at all.</p>

<p>It was my birthday. There were holidays at
school on other birthdays&mdash;none on mine. There
were rejoicings at home on other birthdays, as I
knew from what I heard the girls relate to one
another&mdash;there were none on mine. My birthday
was the most melancholy day at home, in
the whole year.</p>

<p>I have mentioned, that, unless my vanity
should deceive me (as I know it may, for I may
be very vain, without suspecting it&mdash;though indeed
I don't), my comprehension is quickened
when my affection is. My disposition is very affectionate;
and perhaps I might still feel such a
wound, if such a wound could be received more
than once, with the quickness of that birthday.</p>

<p>Dinner was over, and my godmother and I
were sitting at the table before the fire. The
clock ticked, the fire clicked; not another sound
had been heard in the room, or in the house, for
I don't know how long. I happened to look
timidly up from my stitching, across the table,
at my godmother, and I saw in her face, looking
gloomily at me, "It would have been far better,
little Esther, had you had had no birthday; that
you had never been born!"</p>

<p>I broke out sobbing and crying, and I said,
"O, dear godmother, tell me, pray do tell me,
did mamma die on my birthday?"</p>

<p>"No," she returned. "Ask me no more,
child!"</p>

<p>"O, do pray tell me something of her. Do
now, at last, dear godmother, if you please!
What did I do to her? How did I lose her?
Why am I so different from other children, and
why is it my fault, dear godmother? No, no,
no, don't go away. O, speak to me!"</p>

<p>I was in a kind of fright beyond my grief; and
I had caught hold of her dress, and was kneeling
to her. She had been saying all the while, "Let
me go!" But now she stood still.</p>

<p>Her darkened face had such power over me,
that it stopped me in the midst of my vehemence,
I put up my trembling little hand to clasp hers,
or to beg her pardon with what earnestness I
might, but withdrew it as she looked at me,
and laid it on my fluttering heart. She raised
me, sat in her chair, and standing me before her,
said, slowly, in a cold, low voice&mdash;I see her knitted
brow, and pointed finger:</p>

<p>"Your mother, Esther, is your disgrace, and
you were hers. The time will come&mdash;and soon
enough&mdash;when you will understand this better,
and will feel it too, as no one save a woman
can. I have forgiven her;" but her face did
not relent; "the wrong she did to me, and I say
no more of it, though it was greater than you
will ever know&mdash;than any one will ever know,
but I, the sufferer. For yourself, unfortunate
girl, orphaned and degraded from the first of
these evil anniversaries, pray daily that the sins
of others be not visited upon your head, according
to what is written. Forget your mother,
and leave all other people to forget her who will
do her unhappy child that greatest kindness.
Now, go!"</p>

<p>She checked me, however, as I was about to
depart from her&mdash;so frozen as I was!&mdash;and added
this:</p>

<p>"Submission, self-denial, diligent work, are
the preparations for a life begun with such a
shadow on it. You are different from other
children, Esther, because you were not born, like
them, in common sinfulness and wrath. You are
set apart."</p>

<p>I went up to my room, and crept to bed, and
laid my doll's cheek against mine wet with tears;
and holding that solitary friend upon my bosom,
cried myself to sleep. Imperfect as my understanding
of my sorrow was, I knew that I had
brought no joy, at anytime, to anybody's heart,
and that I was to no one upon earth what Dolly
was to me.</p>

<p>Dear, dear, to think how much time we passed
alone together afterward, and how often I repeated
to the doll the story of my birthday, and confided
to her that I would try, as hard as ever I
could, to repair the fault I had been born with
(of which I confusedly felt guilty and yet innocent),
and would strive as I grew up to be industrious,
contented, and kind-hearted, and to do
some good to some one, and win some love to
myself if I could. I hope it is not self-indulgent
to shed these tears as I think of it. I am very
<a class="pagenum" id="page_656" title="pg 656"></a>
thankful, I am very cheerful, but I can not quite
help their coming to my eyes.</p>

<p>There! I have wiped them away now, and
can go on again properly.</p>

<p>I felt the distance between my godmother and
myself so much more after the birthday, and felt
so sensible of filling a place in her house which
ought to have been empty, that I found her more
difficult of approach, though I was fervently
grateful to her in my heart, than ever. I felt in
the same way toward my school companions; I
felt in the same way toward Mrs. Rachael, who
was a widow; and O toward her daughter, of
whom she was proud, who came to see her once
a fortnight! I was very retired and quiet, and
tried to be very diligent.</p>

<p>One sunny afternoon, when I had come home
from school with my books and portfolio, watching
my long shadow at my side, and as I was
gliding up stairs to my room as usual, my godmother
looked out of the parlor door, and called
me back. Sitting with her, I found&mdash;which was
very unusual indeed&mdash;a stranger. A portly, important-looking
gentleman, dressed all in black,
with a white cravat, large gold watch seals, a
pair of gold eye-glasses, and a large seal-ring
upon his little finger.</p>

<p>"This," said my godmother in an under tone,
"is the child." Then she said, in her naturally
stern way of speaking, "This is Esther, sir."</p>

<p>The gentleman put up his eye-glasses to look
at me, and said, "Come here, my dear!" He
shook hands with me, and asked me to take off
my bonnet&mdash;looking at me all the while. When
I had complied, he said, "Ah!" and afterward
"Yes!" And then, taking off his eye-glasses
and folding them in a red case, and leaning back
in his arm-chair, turning the case about in his
two hands he gave my godmother a nod. Upon
that, my godmother said, "You may go up-stairs,
Esther!" and I made him my courtesy
and left him.</p>

<p>It must have been two years afterward, and I
was almost fourteen, when one dreadful night
my godmother and I sat at the fireside. I was
reading aloud, and she was listening. I had
come down at nine o'clock, as I always did, to
read the Bible to her; and was reading, from St.
John, how our Saviour stooped down, writing
with his finger in the dust, when they brought
the sinful woman to him.</p>

<p>"So when they continued asking him, he lifted
up himself and said unto them, He that is
without sin among you, let him first cast a stone
at her!'"</p>

<p>I was stopped by my godmother's rising, putting
her hand to her head, and crying out, in an
awful voice, from quite another part of the book:</p>

<p>"'Watch ye therefore! lest coming suddenly
he find you sleeping. And what I say unto you,
I say unto all, Watch!'"</p>

<p>In an instant, while she stood before me repeating
these words, she fell down on the floor.
I had no need to cry out; her voice had sounded
through the house, and been heard in the street.</p>

<p>She was laid upon her bed. For more than a
week she lay there, little altered outwardly;
with her old handsome, resolute frown that I so
well knew, carved upon her face. Many and
many a time, in the day and in the night, with
my head upon the pillow by her that my whispers
might be plainer to her, I kissed her, thanked
her, prayed for her, asked her for her blessing
and forgiveness, entreated her to give me the least
sign that she knew or heard me. No, no, no.
Her face was immovable. To the very last, and
even afterward, her frown remained unsoftened.</p>

<p>On the day after my poor good godmother was
buried, the gentleman in black with the white
neckcloth re-appeared. I was sent for by Mrs.
Rachael, and found him in the same place, as if
he had never gone away.</p>

<p>"My name is Kenge," he said; "you may
remember it, my child; Kenge and Carboy, Lincoln's
Inn."</p>

<p>I replied, that I remembered to have seen him
once before.</p>

<p>"Pray be seated&mdash;here, near me. Don't distress
yourself; it's of no use. Mrs. Rachael, I
needn't inform you, who were acquainted with
the late Miss Barbary's affairs, that her means
die with her; and that this young lady, now her
aunt is dead&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My aunt, sir!"</p>

<p>"It really is of no use carrying on a deception
when no object is to be gained by it," said Mr.
Kenge, smoothly. "Aunt in fact, though not
in law. Don't distress yourself! Don't weep!
Don't tremble! Mrs. Rachael, our young friend
has no doubt heard of&mdash;the&mdash;a&mdash;Jarndyce and
Jarndyce."</p>

<p>"Never," said Mrs. Rachel.</p>

<p>"Is it possible," pursued Mr. Kenge, putting
up his eye-glasses, "that our young friend&mdash;I
<i>beg</i> you won't distress yourself!&mdash;never heard of
Jarndyce and Jarndyce?"</p>

<p>I shook my head, wondering even what it was.</p>

<p>"Not of Jarndyce and Jarndyce?" said Mr.
Kenge, looking over his glasses at me, and softly
turning the case about and about, as if he were
petting something. "Not of one of the greatest
Chancery suits known? Not of Jarndyce and
Jarndyce&mdash;the&mdash;a&mdash;in itself a monument of Chancery
practice? In which (I would say) every
difficulty, every contingency, every masterly fiction,
every form of procedure known in that court,
is represented over and over again? It is a cause
that could not exist, out of this free and great
country. I should say that the aggregate of
costs in Jarndyce and Jarndyce, Mrs. Rachael;"
I was afraid he addressed himself to her, because
I appeared inattentive; "amounts at the present
hour to from <span class="smcap">SIX-TY</span> to <span class="smcap">SEVEN-TY THOUSAND
POUNDS</span>!" said Mr. Kenge, leaning back in his
chair.</p>

<p>I felt very ignorant, but what could I do? I
was so entirely unacquainted with the subject,
that I understood nothing about it even then.</p>

<p>"And she really never heard of the cause!"
said Mr. Kenge. "Surprising!"
<a class="pagenum" id="page_657" title="pg 657"></a></p>

<p>"Miss Barbary, sir," returned Mrs. Rachael,
"who is now among the Seraphim&mdash;"</p>

<p>("I hope so, I am sure," said Mr. Kenge, politely.)</p>

<p>"&mdash;Wished Esther only to know what would
be serviceable to her. And she knows, from any
teaching she has had here, nothing more."</p>

<p>"Well!" said Mr. Kenge. "Upon the whole,
very proper. Now to the point," addressing me.
"Miss Barbary, your sole relation (in fact, that
is; for I am bound to observe that in law you
had none), being deceased, and it naturally not
being to be expected that Mrs. Rachael&mdash;"</p>

<p>"O dear no!" said Mrs. Rachael, quickly.</p>

<p>"Quite so," assented Mr. Kenge; "that Mrs.
Rachael should charge herself with your maintenance
and support (I beg you won't distress
yourself), you are in a position to receive the renewal
of an offer which I was instructed to make
to Miss Barbary some two years ago, and which,
though rejected then, was understood to be renewable
under the lamentable circumstances that
have since occurred. Now, if I avow that I represent,
in Jarndyce and Jarndyce, and otherwise,
a highly humane, but at the same time singular
man, shall I compromise myself by any stretch
of my professional caution?" said Mr. Kenge,
leaning back in his chair again, and looking
calmly at us both.</p>

<p>He appeared to enjoy beyond every thing, the
sound of his own voice. I couldn't wonder at
that, for it was mellow and full, and gave great
importance to every word he uttered. He listened
to himself with obvious satisfaction, and sometimes
gently beat time to his own music with his
head, or rounded a sentence with his hand. I
was very much impressed by him&mdash;even then,
before I knew that he formed himself on the
model of a great lord who was his client,
and that he was generally called Conversation
Kenge.</p>

<p>"Mr. Jarndyce," he pursued, "being aware
of the&mdash;I would say, desolate&mdash;position of our
young friend, offers to place her at a first-rate
establishment; where her education shall be completed,
where her comfort shall be secured, where
her reasonable wants shall be anticipated, where
she shall be eminently qualified to discharge her
duty in that station of life unto which it has
pleased&mdash;shall I say Providence?&mdash;to call her."</p>

<p>My heart was filled so full, both by what he
said, and by his affecting manner of saying it,
that I was not able to speak, though I tried.</p>

<p>"Mr. Jarndyce," he went on, "makes no condition,
beyond expressing his expectation, that
our young friend will not at any time remove
herself from the establishment in question without
his knowledge and concurrence. That she
will faithfully apply herself to the acquisition of
those accomplishments, upon the exercise of which
she will be ultimately dependent. That she will
tread in the paths of virtue, and honor, and&mdash;the&mdash;a&mdash;so
forth."</p>

<p>I was still less able to speak than before.</p>

<p>"Now, what does our young friend say?" proceeded
Mr. Kenge. "Take time, take time! I
pause for her reply. But take time!"</p>

<p>What the destitute subject of such an offer
tried to say, I need not repeat. What she did
say, I could more easily tell, if it were worth the
telling. What she felt, and will feel to her dying
hour, I could never relate.</p>

<p>This interview took place at Windsor, where
I had passed (as far as I knew) my whole life.
On that day week, amply provided with all necessaries,
I left it, inside the stage-coach, for Reading.</p>

<p>Mrs. Rachael was too good to feel any emotion
at parting, but I was not so good, and wept bitterly.
I thought that I ought to have known
her better after so many years, and ought to
have made myself enough of a favorite with her
to make her sorry then. When she gave me one
cold, parting kiss upon my forehead, like a thaw-drop
from the stone porch&mdash;it was a very frosty
day&mdash;I felt so miserable and self-reproachful that
I clung to her and told her it was my fault, I
knew, that she could say good-by so easily!</p>

<p>"No, Esther!" she returned. "It is your
misfortune!"</p>

<p>The coach was at the little lawn gate&mdash;we
had not come out until we heard the wheels&mdash;and
thus I left her, with a sorrowful heart. She
went in before my boxes were lifted to the coach-roof,
and shut the door. As long as I could see
the house, I looked back at it from the window,
through my tears. My godmother had left Mrs.
Rachael all the little property she possessed; and
there was to be a sale; and an old hearth-rug
with roses on it, which always seemed to me the
first thing in the world I had ever seen, was
hanging outside in the frost and snow. A day
or two before, I had wrapped the dear old doll in
her own shawl, and quietly laid her&mdash;I am half-ashamed
to tell it&mdash;in the garden-earth, under
the tree that shaded my own window. I had no
companion left but my bird, and him I carried
with me in his cage.</p>

<p>When the house was out of sight, I sat, with
my bird-cage in the straw at my feet, forward
on the low seat to look out of the high window;
watching the frosty trees that were like beautiful
pieces of spar; and the fields all smooth and
white with last night's snow; and the sun so
red but yielding so little heat; and the ice, dark
like metal, where the skaters and sliders had
brushed the snow away. There was a gentleman
in the coach who sat on the opposite seat, and
looked very large in a quantity of wrappings;
but he sat gazing out of the other window, and
took no notice of me.</p>

<p>I thought of my dead godmother; of the night
when I read to her; of her frowning so fixedly
and sternly in her bed; of the strange place I
was going to; of the people I should find there,
and what they would be like, and what they
would say to me; when a voice in the coach
gave me a terrible start.</p>

<p>It said, "What the de-vil are you crying for?"</p>

<p>I was so frightened that I lost my voice, and
could only answer in a whisper. "Me, sir?"
<a class="pagenum" id="page_658" title="pg 658"></a>
For of course I knew it must have been the gentleman
in the quantity of wrappings, though he
was still looking out of his window.</p>

<p>"Yes, you," he said, turning round.</p>

<p>"I didn't know I was crying, sir," I faltered.</p>

<p>"But you are!" said the gentleman. "Look
here!" He came quite opposite to me from the
other corner of the coach, brushed one of his
large furry cuffs across my eyes (but without
hurting me), and showed me that it was wet.</p>

<p>"There! Now, you know you are," he said.
"Don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," I said.</p>

<p>"And what are you crying for?" said the
gentleman. "Don't you want to go there?"</p>

<p>"Where, sir?"</p>

<p>"Where? Why, wherever you are going,"
said the gentleman.</p>

<p>"I am very glad to go there, sir," I answered.</p>

<p>"Well, then! Look glad!" said the gentleman.</p>

<p>I thought he was very strange, or at least that
what I could see of him was very strange, for he
was wrapped up to the chin, and his face was
almost hidden in a fur cap, with broad fur straps
at the side of his head, fastened under his chin;
but I was composed again, and not afraid of him.
So I told him that I thought I must have been
crying, because of my godmother's death, and
because of Mrs. Rachael's not being sorry to part
with me.</p>

<p>"Con-found Mrs. Rachael!" said the gentleman.
"Let her fly away in a high wind on a
broomstick!"</p>

<p>I began to be really afraid of him now, and
looked at him with the greatest astonishment.
But I thought that he had pleasant eyes, although
he kept on muttering to himself in an
angry manner, and calling Mrs. Rachael names.</p>

<p>After a little while, he opened his outer wrapper,
which appeared to me large enough to wrap
up the whole coach, and put his arm down into
a deep pocket in the side.</p>

<p>"Now, look here!" he said. "In this paper,"
which was nicely folded, "is a piece of the best
plum-cake that can be got for money&mdash;sugar on
the outside an inch thick, like fat on muttonchops.
Here's a little pie (a gem this is, both for
size and quality), made in France. And what do
you suppose it's made of? Livers of fat geese.
There's a pie! Now let's see you eat 'em."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," I replied; "thank you very
much, indeed, but I hope you won't be offended;
they are too rich for me."</p>

<p>"Floored again!" said the gentleman, which
I didn't at all understand; and threw them both
out of window.</p>

<p>He did not speak to me any more, until he got
out of the coach a little way short of Reading,
when he advised me to be a good girl, and to be
studious; and shook hands with me. I must
say I was relieved by his departure. We left him
at a milestone. I often walked past it afterward,
and never, for a long time, without thinking of
him, and half-expecting to meet him. But I
never did; and so, as time went on, he passed
out of my mind.</p>

<p>When the coach stopped, a very neat lady
looked up at the window, and said,</p>

<p>"Miss Donny."</p>

<p>"No, ma'am, Esther Summerson."</p>

<p>"That is quite right," said the lady, "Miss
Donny."</p>

<p>I now understood that she introduced herself
by that name, and begged Miss Donny's pardon
for my mistake, and pointed out my boxes at her
request. Under the direction of a very neat maid,
they were put outside a very small green carriage;
and then Miss Donny, the maid, and I,
got inside, and were driven away.</p>

<p>"Every thing is ready for you, Esther," said
Miss Donny; "and the scheme of your pursuits
has been arranged in exact accordance with the
wishes of your guardian, Mr. Jarndyce."</p>

<p>"Of &mdash;&mdash;, did you say, ma'am?"</p>

<p>"Of your guardian, Mr. Jarndyce," said Miss
Donny.</p>

<p>I was so bewildered that Miss Donny thought
the cold had been too severe for me, and lent me
her smelling-bottle.</p>

<p>"Do you know my&mdash;guardian, Mr. Jarndyce,
ma'am?" I asked, after a good deal of hesitation.</p>

<p>"Not personally, Esther," said Miss Donny;
"merely through his solicitors, Messrs. Kenge
and Carboy, of London. A very superior gentleman,
Mr. Kenge. Truly eloquent, indeed. Some
of his periods quite majestic!"</p>

<p>I felt this to be very true, but was too confused
to attend to it. Our speedy arrival at our
destination, before I had time to recover myself,
increased my confusion; and I never shall forget
the uncertain and unreal air of every thing at
Greenleaf (Miss Donny's house), that afternoon!</p>

<p>But I soon became used to it. I was so adapted
to the routine of Greenleaf before long, that I
seemed to have been there a great while; and
almost to have dreamed, rather than to have
really lived, my old life at my godmother's.
Nothing could be more precise, exact, and orderly,
than Greenleaf. There was a time for every
thing all round the dial of the clock, and every
thing was done at its appointed moment.</p>

<p>We were twelve boarders, and there were two
Miss Donnys, twins. It was understood that I
would have to depend, by-and-by, on my qualifications
as a governess; and I was not only instructed
in every thing that was taught at Greenleaf,
but was very soon engaged in helping to
instruct others. Although I was treated in every
other respect like the rest of the school, this single
difference was made in my case from the first.
As I began to know more, I taught more, and so
in course of time I had plenty to do, which I was
very fond of doing, because it made the dear girls
fond of me. At last, whenever a new pupil came,
who was a little downcast and unhappy, she was
so sure&mdash;indeed I don't know why&mdash;to make a
friend of me, that all new-comers were confided
to my care. They said I was so gentle; but I
<a class="pagenum" id="page_659" title="pg 659"></a>
am sure <i>they</i> were! I often thought of the resolution
I had made on my birth-day, to try to be
industrious, contented, and true-hearted, and to
do some good to some one, and win some love
if I could; and indeed, indeed, I felt almost
ashamed to have done so little, and have won so
much.</p>

<p>I passed at Greenleaf six happy, quiet years.
I never saw in any face there, thank Heaven, on
my birthday, that it would have been better
if I had never been born. When the day came
round, it brought me so many tokens of affectionate
remembrance, that my room was beautiful
with them from New-Year's Day to Christmas.</p>

<p>In those six years I had never been away, except
on visits at holiday time in the neighborhood.
After the first six months or so, I had
taken Miss Donny's advice in reference to the
propriety of writing to Mr. Kenge, to say that I
was happy and grateful; and, with her approval,
I had written such a letter. I had received a
formal answer acknowledging its receipt, and
saying, "We note the contents thereof, which
shall be duly communicated to our client."
After that, I sometimes heard Miss Donny and
her sister mention how regularly my accounts
were paid; and about twice a year I ventured to
write a similar letter. I always received by
return of post exactly the same answer, in the
same round hand; with the signature of Kenge
and Carboy in another writing, which I supposed
to be Mr. Kenge's.</p>

<p>It seems so curious to me to be obliged to
write all this about myself!&mdash;as if this narrative
were the narrative of <i>my</i> life! But my little
body will soon fall into the background now.</p>

<p>Six quiet years (I find I am saying it for the
second time) I had passed at Greenleaf, seeing in
those around me, as it might be in a looking-glass,
every stage of my own growth and change
there, when, one November morning, I received
this letter. I omit the date.</p>

<p><i>Miss Esther Summerson.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>O, never, never, never shall I forget the emotion
this letter caused in the house! It was so tender
in them to care so much for me; it was so gracious
in that Father who had not forgotten me, to have
made my orphan way so smooth and easy, and
to have inclined so many youthful natures toward
me; that I could hardly bear it. Not that I
would have had them less sorry&mdash;I am afraid not;
but the pleasure of it, and the pain of it, and the
pride and joy of it, and the humble regret of it,
were so blended, that my heart seemed almost
breaking while it was full of rapture.</p>

<p>The letter gave me only five days' notice of my
removal. When every minute added to the proofs
of love and kindness that were given me in those
five days; and when at last the morning came,
and when they took me through all the rooms,
that I might see them for the last time; and
when some cried "Esther, dear, say good-by to
me here, at my bedside, where you first spoke so
kindly to me!" and when others asked me only
to write their names, "With Esther's love;" and
when they all surrounded mo with their parting
presents, and clung to me weeping, and cried,
"What shall we do when dear Esther's gone!"
and when I tried to tell them how forbearing, and
how good they had all been to me, and how I
blessed, and thanked them every one; what a
heart I had!</p>

<p>And when the two Miss Donnys grieved as
much to part with me, as the least among them;
and when the maids said, "Bless you, miss,
wherever you go!" and when the ugly lame old
gardener, who I thought had hardly noticed me
in all those years, came panting after the coach
to give me a little nosegay of geraniums, and
told me I had been the light of his eyes&mdash;indeed
the old man said so!&mdash;what a heart I had then!</p>

<p>And could I help it, if with all this, and the
coming to the little school, and the unexpected
sight of the poor children outside waving their
hats and bonnets to me, and of a gray-headed
gentleman and lady, whose daughter I had helped
to teach, and at whose house I had visited
(who were said to be the proudest people in all
that country), caring for nothing but calling out
"Good-by, Esther. May you be very happy!"
could I help it if I was quite bowed down in the
coach by myself, and said, "O, I am so thankful,
I am so thankful!" many times over!</p>

<p>But of course I soon considered that I must not
take tears where I was going, after all that had
been done for me. Therefore, of course, I made
myself sob less, and persuaded myself to be
quiet, by saying very often, "Esther! now, you
really must! This <i>will not</i> do!" I cheered myself
up pretty well at last, though I am afraid I
was longer about it than I ought to have been;
and when I had cooled my eyes with lavender
water, it was time to watch for London.</p>

<p>I was quite persuaded that we were there, when
we were ten miles off; and when we really were
there, that we should never get there. However,
when we began to jolt upon a stone pavement,
and particularly when every other conveyance
seemed to be running into us and we seemed to
be running into every other conveyance, I began
<a class="pagenum" id="page_660" title="pg 660"></a>
to believe that we really were approaching the
end of our journey. Very soon afterward we
stopped.</p>

<p>A young gentleman who had inked himself by
accident, addressed me from the pavement, and
said, "I am from Kenge and Carboy's, miss, of
Lincoln's Inn."</p>

<p>"If you please, sir," said I.</p>

<p>He was very obliging; and as he handed me
into a fly, after superintending the removal of my
boxes, I asked him whether there was a great fire
any where? For the streets were so full of dense
brown smoke that scarcely any thing was to be
seen.</p>

<p>"O dear no, miss," he said. "This is a London
particular."</p>

<p>I had never heard of such a thing.</p>

<p>"A fog, miss," said the young gentleman.</p>

<p>"O indeed!" said I.</p>

<p>We drove slowly through the dirtiest and darkest
streets that ever were seen in the world (I
thought), and in such a distracting state of confusion
that I wondered how the people kept their
senses, until we passed into sudden quietude under
an old gateway, and drove on through a silent
square, until we came to an odd nook in a corner,
where there was an entrance up a steep broad
flight of stairs, like an entrance to a church. And
there really was a church-yard outside under some
cloisters, for I saw the grave-stones from the staircase
window.</p>

<p>This was Kenge and Carboy's. The young
gentleman showed me through an outer office into
Mr. Kenge's room&mdash;there was no one in it&mdash;and
politely put an arm-chair for me by the fire. He
then called my attention to a little looking-glass,
hanging from a nail on one side, of the chimney-piece.</p>

<p>"In case you should wish to look at yourself,
miss, after the journey, as you're going before the
Chancellor. Not that it's necessary, I am sure,"
said the young gentleman, civilly.</p>

<p>"Going before the Chancellor?" I said, startled
for a moment.</p>

<p>"Only a matter of form, miss," returned the
young gentleman. "Mr. Kenge is in court now.
He left his compliments, and would you partake
of some refreshment;" there were biscuits and a
decanter of wine on a small table; "and look
over the paper;" which the young gentleman
gave me as he spoke. He then stirred the fire,
and left me.</p>

<p>Every thing was so strange&mdash;the stranger for
its being night in the day-time, and the candles
burning with a white flame, and looking raw and
cold&mdash;that I read the words in the newspaper
without knowing what they meant, and found
myself reading the same words repeatedly. As
it was of no use going on in that way, I put the
paper down, took a peep at my bonnet in the
glass to see if it was neat, and looked at the
room which was not half lighted, and at the
shabby dusty tables, and at the piles of writings,
and at a bookcase full of the most inexpressive-looking
books that ever had any thing to say for
themselves. Then I went on, thinking, thinking,
thinking; and the fire went on, burning, burning,
burning; and the candles went on flickering and
guttering, and there were no snuffers&mdash;until the
young gentleman by-and-by brought a very dirty
pair; for two hours.</p>

<p>At last Mr. Kenge came. <i>He</i> was not altered;
but he was surprised to see how altered I was,
and appeared quite pleased. "As you are going
to be the companion of the young lady who is
now in the Chancellor's private room, Miss Summerson,"
he said, "we thought it well that you
should be in attendance also. You will not be discomposed
by the Lord Chancellor, I dare say?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," I said, "I don't think I shall."
Really not seeing, on consideration, why I should
be.</p>

<p>So Mr. Kenge gave me his arm, and we went
round the corner, under a colonnade, and in at a
side door. And so we came, along a passage,
into a comfortable sort of room, where a young
lady and a young gentleman were standing near
a great, loud-roaring fire. A screen was interposed
between them and it, and they were leaning
on the screen, talking.</p>

<p>They both looked up when I came in, and I
saw in the young lady, with the fire shining upon
her, such a beautiful girl! With such rich golden
hair, such soft blue eyes, and such a bright, innocent,
trusting face!</p>

<p>"Miss Ada," said Mr. Kenge, "this is Miss
Summerson."</p>

<p>She came to meet me with a smile of welcome,
and her hand extended, but seemed to change
her mind in a moment, and kissed me. In short,
she had such a natural, captivating, winning
manner, that in a few minutes we were sitting
in the window-seat, with the light of the fire
upon us, talking together, as free and happy as
could be.</p>

<p>What a load off my mind! It was so delightful
to know that she could confide in me, and like
me! It was so good of her, and so encouraging
to me!</p>

<p>The young gentleman was her distant cousin,
she told me, and his name Richard Carstone.
He was a handsome youth, with an ingenuous
face, and a most engaging laugh; and after she
had called him up to where we sat, he stood by
us, in the light of the fire too, talking gayly, like
a light-hearted boy. He was very young; not
more than nineteen then, if quite so much, but
nearly two years older than she was. They were
both orphans, and (what was very unexpected
and curious to me) had never met before that
day. Our all three coming together for the first
time, in such an unusual place, was a thing to
talk about; and we talked about it; and the fire,
which had left off roaring, winked its red eyes at
us&mdash;as Richard said&mdash;like a drowsy old Chancery
lion.</p>

<p>We conversed in a low tone, because a full-dressed
gentleman in a bag wig frequently came
in and out, and when he did so, we could hear a
drawling sound in the distance, which he said
<a class="pagenum" id="page_661" title="pg 661"></a>
was one of the counsel in our case addressing
the Lord Chancellor. He told Mr. Kenge that
the Chancellor would be up in five minutes; and
presently we heard a bustle, and a tread of feet,
and Mr. Kenge said that the Court had risen, and
his lordship was in the next room.</p>

<p>The gentleman in the bag wig opened the door
almost directly, and requested Mr. Kenge to come
in. Upon that, we all went into the next room;
Mr. Kenge first, with my darling&mdash;it is so natural
to me now, that I can't help writing it; and
there, plainly dressed in black, and sitting in an
arm-chair at a table near the fire, was his lordship,
whose robe, trimmed with beautiful gold
lace, was thrown upon another chair. He gave
us a searching look as we entered, but his manner
was both courtly and kind.</p>

<p>The gentleman in the bag wig laid bundles of
papers on his lordship's table, and his lordship
silently selected one, and turned over the leaves.</p>

<p>"Miss Clare," then said the Lord Chancellor.
"Miss Ada Clare?"</p>

<p>Mr. Kenge presented her, and his lordship
begged her to sit down near him. That he admired
her, and was interested by her, even <i>I</i>
could see in a moment. It touched me, that the
home of such a beautiful young creature should
be represented by that dry official place. The
Lord High Chancellor, at his best, appeared so
poor a substitute for the love and pride of parents.</p>

<p>"The Jarndyce in question," said the Lord
Chancellor, still turning over leaves, "is Jarndyce
of Bleak House."</p>

<p>"Jarndyce of Bleak House, my lord," said Mr.
Kenge.</p>

<p>"A dreary name," said the Lord Chancellor.</p>

<p>"But not a dreary place at present, my lord,"
said Mr. Kenge.</p>

<p>"And Bleak House," said his lordship, "is
in&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hertfordshire, my lord."</p>

<p>"Mr. Jarndyce of Bleak House is not married?"
said his lordship.</p>

<p>"He is not, my lord," said Mr. Kenge.</p>

<p>A pause.</p>

<p>"Young Mr. Richard Carstone is present?"
said the Lord Chancellor, glancing toward him.</p>

<p>Richard bowed and stepped forward.</p>

<p>"Hum!" said the Lord Chancellor, turning
over more leaves.</p>

<p>"Mr. Jarndyce of Bleak House, my lord," Mr.
Kenge observed, in a low voice, "if I may venture
to remind your lordship, provides a suitable
companion for&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For Mr. Richard Carstone?" I thought (but I
am not quite sure) I heard his lordship say, in an
equally low voice, and with a smile.</p>

<p>"For Miss Ada Clare. This is the young lady.
Miss Summerson."</p>

<p>His lordship gave me an indulgent look, and
acknowledged my courtesy very graciously.</p>

<p>"Miss Summerson is not related to any party
in the cause, I think?"</p>

<p>"No, my lord."</p>

<p>Mr. Kenge leant over before it was quite said,
and whispered. His lordship, with his eyes upon
his papers, listened, nodded twice or thrice, turned
over more leaves, and did not look toward me
again, until we were going away.</p>

<p>Mr. Kenge now retired, and Richard with
him, to where I was, near the door, leaving my
pet (it is so natural to me that again I can't help
it!) sitting near the Lord Chancellor; with whom
his lordship spoke a little apart; asking her, as
she told me afterward, whether she had well reflected
on the proposed arrangement, and if she
thought she would be happy under the roof of Mr.
Jarndyce of Bleak House, and why she thought
so? Presently he rose courteously, and released
her, and then he spoke for a minute or two with
Richard Carstone; not seated, but standing, and
altogether with more ease and less ceremony&mdash;as
if he still knew, though he <i>was</i> Lord Chancellor,
how to go straight to the candor of a boy.</p>

<p>"Very well!" said his lordship aloud. "I
shall make the order. Mr. Jarndyce of Bleak
House has chosen, so far as I may judge," and
this was when he looked at me, "a very good
companion for the young lady, and the arrangement
altogether seems the best of which the circumstances
admit."</p>

<p>He dismissed us pleasantly, and we all went
out, very much obliged to him for being so affable
and polite; by which he had certainly lost no
dignity, but seemed to us to have gained some.</p>

<p>When we got under the colonnade, Mr. Kenge
remembered that he must go back for a moment
to ask a question; and left us in the fog, with the
Lord Chancellor's carriage and servants waiting
for him to come out.</p>

<p>"Well!" said Richard Carstone, "<i>that's</i> over!
And where do we go next, Miss Summerson?"</p>

<p>"Don't you know?" I said.</p>

<p>"Not in the least," said he.</p>

<p>"And don't <i>you</i> know, my love?" I asked
Ada.</p>

<p>"No!" said she. "Don't you?"</p>

<p>"Not at all!" said I.</p>

<p>We looked at one another, half-laughing at our
being like the children in the wood, when a curious
little old woman in a squeezed bonnet, and
carrying a reticule, came courtesying and smiling
up to us, with an air of great ceremony.</p>

<p>"O!" said she. "The wards in Jarndyce!
Ve-ry happy, I am sure, to have the honor! It
is a good omen for youth, and hope, and beauty,
when they find themselves in this place, and don't
know what's to come of it."</p>

<p>"Mad!" whispered Richard, not thinking she
could hear him.</p>

<p>"Right! Mad, young gentleman," she returned
so quickly that he was quite abashed. "I was
a ward myself. I was not mad at that time,"
courtesying low, and smiling between every little
sentence. "I had youth, and hope. I believe,
beauty. It matters very little now. Neither of
the three served, or saved me. I have the honor
to attend court regularly. With my documents.
I expect a judgment. Shortly. On the Day of
Judgment. I have discovered that the sixth seal
<a class="pagenum" id="page_662" title="pg 662"></a>
mentioned in the Revelations is the Great Seal.
It has been open a long time! Pray accept my
blessing."</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illo_15.jpg" width="100%"
alt="THE LITTLE OLD LADY."
title="THE LITTLE OLD LADY." />
<p class="center">THE LITTLE OLD LADY.</p>
</div>

<p>As Ada was a little frightened, I said, to humor
the poor old lady, that we were much obliged to her.</p>

<p>"Ye-es!" she said, mincingly. "I imagine so.
And here is Conversation Kenge. With <i>his</i> documents.
How does your honorable worship do?"</p>

<p>"Quite well, quite well! Now don't be troublesome,
that's a good soul!" said Mr. Kenge,
leading the way back.</p>

<p>"By no means," said the poor old lady, keeping
up with Ada and me. "Any thing but
troublesome. I shall confer estates on both&mdash;which
is not being troublesome, I trust? I expect
a judgment. Shortly. On the Day of Judgment.
This is a good omen for you. Accept my
blessing!"</p>

<p>She stopped at the bottom of the steep, broad
flight of stairs; but we looked back as we went
up, and she was still there, saying, still with a
courtesy and a smile between every little sentence,
"Youth. And hope. And beauty. And Chancery.
And Conversation Kenge! Ha! Pray
accept my blessing!"</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Telescopic Philanthropy.</span></h3>

<p>We were to pass the night, Mr. Kenge told us
when we arrived in his room, at Mrs. Jellyby's;
and then he turned to me, and said he took it for
granted I knew who Mrs. Jellyby was?</p>

<p>"I really don't, sir," I returned. "Perhaps
Mr. Carstone&mdash;or Miss Clare&mdash;"</p>

<p>But no, they knew nothing whatever about
Mrs. Jellyby.</p>

<p>"In-deed! Mrs. Jellyby," said Mr. Kenge,
standing with his back to the fire, and casting
his eyes over the dusty hearth-rug as if it were
Mrs. Jellyby's biography, "is a lady of very remarkable
strength of character, who devotes herself
entirely to the public. She has devoted herself
to an extensive variety of public subjects, at
various times, and is at present (until something
else attracts her) devoted to the subject of Africa,
with a view to the general cultivation of the
coffee berry&mdash;<i>and</i> the natives&mdash;and the happy
settlement, on the banks of the African rivers, of
our superabundant home population. Mr. Jarndyce,
who is desirous to aid in any work that is
considered likely to be a good work, and who
is much sought after by philanthropists, has
<a class="pagenum" id="page_663" title="pg 663"></a>
I believe, a very high opinion of Mrs. Jellyby."</p>

<p>Mr. Kenge, adjusting his cravat, then looked
at us.</p>

<p>"And Mr. Jellyby, sir?" suggested Richard.</p>

<p>"Ah! Mr. Jellyby," said Mr. Kenge, "is&mdash;a&mdash;I
don't know that I can describe him to you better
than by saying that he is the husband of Mrs.
Jellyby."</p>

<p>"A nonentity, sir?" said Richard, with a
droll look.</p>

<p>"I don't say that," returned Mr. Kenge, gravely.
"I can't say that, indeed, for I know nothing
whatever <i>of</i> Mr. Jellyby. I never, to my knowledge,
had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Jellyby. He
may be a very superior man; but he is, so to
speak, merged&mdash;merged&mdash;in the more shining
qualities of his wife." Mr. Kenge proceeded to
tell us that as the road to Bleak House would
have been very long, dark, and tedious, on such
an evening, and as we had been traveling already,
Mr. Jarndyce had himself proposed this arrangement.
A carriage would be at Mrs. Jellyby's to
convey us out of town, early in the forenoon of
to-morrow.</p>

<p>He then rang a little bell, and the young gentleman
came in. Addressing him by the name
of Guppy, Mr. Kenge inquired whether Miss Summerson's
boxes and the rest of the baggage had
been "sent round." Mr. Guppy said yes, they
had been sent round, and a coach was waiting to
take us round too, as soon as we pleased.</p>

<p>"Then it only remains," said Mr. Kenge, shaking
hands with us, "for me to express my lively
satisfaction in (good-day, Miss Clare!) the arrangement
this day concluded, and my (<i>good</i>-by
to you, Miss Summerson!) lively hope that it will
conduce to the happiness, the (glad to have had
the honor of making your acquaintance, Mr. Carstone!)
welfare, the advantage in all points of
view, of all concerned! Guppy, see the party
safely there."</p>

<p>"Where <i>is</i> 'there,' Mr. Guppy?" said Richard,
as he went down stairs.</p>

<p>"No distance," said Mr. Guppy; "round in
Thavies' Inn, you know."</p>

<p>"I can't say I know where it is, for I come from
Winchester, and am strange in London."</p>

<p>"Only round the corner," said Mr. Guppy.
"We just twist up Chancery-lane, and out along
Holborn, and there we are in four minutes' time,
as near as a toucher. This is about a London
particular <i>
ow</i>, ain't it, miss?" He seemed quite
delighted with it on my account.</p>

<p>"The fog is very dense indeed!" said I.</p>

<p>"Not that it affects you, though, I am sure,"
said Mr. Guppy, putting up the steps. "On the
contrary, it seems to do you good, miss, judging
from your appearance."</p>

<p>I knew he meant well in paying me this compliment,
so I laughed at myself for blushing at
it, when he had shut the door and got upon the
box; and we all three laughed, and chatted about
our inexperience, and the strangeness of London,
until we turned up under an archway, to our
destination: a narrow street of high houses, like
an oblong cistern to hold the fog. There was a
confused little crowd of people, principally children,
gathered about the house at which we stopped,
which had a tarnished brass plate on the
door, with the inscription, <span class="smcap">Jellyby</span>.</p>

<p>"Don't be frightened!" said Mr. Guppy, look-in
at the coach-window. "One of the young
Jellybys been and got his head through the area
railings!"</p>

<p>"O poor child," said I, "let me out, if you
please!"</p>

<p>"Pray be careful of yourself, miss. The young
Jellybys are always up to something," said Mr.
Guppy.</p>

<p>I made my way to the poor child, who was
one of the dirtiest little unfortunates I ever saw,
and found him very hot and frightened, and crying
loudly, fixed by the neck between two iron
railings, while a milk-man and a beadle, with
the kindest intentions possible, were endeavoring
to drag him back by the legs, under a general
impression that his skull was compressible by
those means. As I found (after pacifying him),
that he was a little boy, with a naturally large
head, I thought that, perhaps, where his head
could go, his body could follow, and mentioned
that the best mode of extrication might be to
push him forward. This was so favorably received
by the milk-man and beadle, that he would
immediately have been pushed into the area, if I
had not held his pinafore, while Richard and Mr.
Guppy ran down through the kitchen, to catch
him when he should be released. At last he was
happily got down without any accident, and then
he began to beat Mr. Guppy with a hoop-stick in
quite a frantic manner.</p>

<p>
obody had appeared belonging to the house,
except a person in pattens, who had been poking
at the child from below with a broom; I don't
know with what object, and I don't think she did.
I therefore supposed that Mrs. Jellyby was not at
home; and was quite surprised when the person
appeared in the passage without the pattens, and
going up to the back room on the first floor, before
Ada and me, announced us as, "Them two
young ladies, Missis Jellyby!" We passed several
more children on the way up, whom it was
difficult to avoid treading on in the dark; and as
we came into Mrs. Jellyby's presence, one of the
poor little things fell down stairs&mdash;down a whole
flight (as it sounded to me), with a great noise.</p>

<p>Mrs. Jellyby, whose face reflected none of the
uneasiness which we could not help showing in
our own faces, as the dear child's head recorded
its passage with a bump on every stair&mdash;Richard
afterward said he counted seven, besides one for
the landing&mdash;received us with perfect equanimity.
She was a pretty, very diminutive, plump woman,
of from forty to fifty, with handsome eyes, though
they had a curious habit of seeming to look a long
way off. As if&mdash;I am quoting Richard again&mdash;they
could see nothing nearer than Africa!</p>

<p>"I am very glad indeed," said Mrs. Jellyby,
in an agreeable voice, "to have the pleasure of
<a class="pagenum" id="page_664" title="pg 664"></a>
receiving you. I have a great respect for Mr.
Jarndyce; and no one in whom he is interested
can be an object of indifference to me."</p>

<p>We expressed our acknowledgments, and sat
down behind the door, where there was a lame
invalid of a sofa. Mrs. Jellyby had very good
hair, but was too much occupied with her African
duties to brush it. The shawl in which she had
been loosely muffled, dropped on to her chair
when she advanced to us; and as she turned to
resume her seat, we could not help noticing that
her dress didn't nearly meet up the back, and the
open space was railed across with a lattice-work
of stay-lace, like a summer-house.</p>

<p>The room, which was strewn with papers and
nearly filled by a great writing-table covered with
similar litter, was, I must say, not only very untidy,
but very dirty. We were obliged to take
notice of that with our sense of sight, even while,
with our sense of hearing, we followed the poor
child who had tumbled down stairs: I think into
the back kitchen, where somebody seemed to stifle
him.</p>

<p>But what principally struck us was a jaded,
and unhealthy-looking, though by no means plain
girl, at the writing-table, who sat biting the
feather of her pen, and staring at us. I suppose
nobody ever was in such a state of ink. And,
from her tumbled hair to her pretty feet, which
were disfigured with frayed and broken slippers
trodden down at heel, she really seemed to have
no article of dress upon her, from a pin upward,
that was in its proper condition or its right place.</p>

<p>"You find me, my dears," said Mrs. Jellyby,
snuffing the two great office candles in tin candle-sticks,
which made the room taste strongly of hot
tallow (the fire had gone out, and there was
nothing in the grate but ashes, a bundle of wood,
and a poker), "you find me, my dears, as usual,
very busy; but that you will excuse. The African
project at present employs my whole time. It
involves me in correspondence with public bodies,
and with private individuals anxious for the welfare
of their species all over the country. I am
happy to say it is advancing. We hope by this
time next year to have from a hundred and fifty
to two hundred healthy families cultivating coffee
and educating the natives of Borrioboola-Gha, on
the left bank of the Niger."</p>

<p>As Ada said nothing, but looked at me, I said
it must be very gratifying.</p>

<p>"It is gratifying," said Mrs. Jellyby. "It
involves the devotion of all my energies, such as
they are; but that is nothing, so that it succeeds;
and I am more confident of success every day.
Do you know, Miss Summerson, I almost wonder
that <i>you</i> never turned your thoughts to Africa?"</p>

<p>This application of the subject was really so
unexpected to me, that I was quite at a loss how
to receive it. I hinted that the climate&mdash;</p>

<p>"The finest climate in the world!" said Mrs.
Jellyby.</p>

<p>"Indeed, ma'am?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. With precaution," said Mrs. Jellyby.
"You may go into Holborn, without precaution,
and be run over. You may go into Holborn
with precaution, and never be run over.
Just so with Africa."</p>

<p>I said, "No doubt."&mdash;I meant as to Holborn.</p>

<p>"If you would like," said Mrs. Jellyby, putting
a number of papers toward us, "to look over
some remarks on that head, and on the general
subject (which have been extensively circulated),
while I finish a letter, I am now dictating&mdash;to
my eldest daughter, who is my amanuensis&mdash;"</p>

<p>The girl at the table left off biting her pen, and
made a return to our recognition, which was half
bashful and half sulky.</p>

<p>"&mdash;I shall then have finished for the present,"
proceeded Mrs. Jellyby, with a sweet smile;
"though my work is never done. Where are
you, Caddy?"</p>

<p>"Presents her compliments to Mr. Swallow,
and begs&mdash;'" said Caddy.</p>

<p>"'&mdash;And begs,'" said Mrs. Jellyby, dictating,
"to inform him, in reference to his letter of inquiry
on the African project.'&mdash;No, Peepy! Not
on any account!"</p>

<p>Peepy (so self-named) was the unfortunate
child who had fallen down stairs, who now interrupted
the correspondence by presenting himself,
with a strip of plaster on his forehead, to
exhibit his wounded knees, in which Ada and I
did not know which to pity most&mdash;the bruises or
the dirt. Mrs. Jellyby merely added, with the
serene composure with which she said every
thing, "Go along, you naughty Peepy!" and
fixed her fine eyes on Africa again.</p>

<p>However, as she at once proceeded with her
dictation, and as I interrupted nothing by doing
so, I ventured quietly to stop poor Peepy as he
was going out, and to take him up to nurse.
He looked very much astonished at it, and at
Ada's kissing him; but soon fell fast asleep in
my arms, sobbing at longer and longer intervals,
until he was quiet. I was so occupied with
Peepy that I lost the letter in detail, though I
derived such a general impression from it of the
momentous importance of Africa, and the utter
insignificance of all other places and things, that
I felt quite ashamed to have thought so little
about it.</p>

<p>"Six o'clock!" said Mrs. Jellyby. "And our
dinner hour is nominally (for we dine at all hours)
five! Caddy, show Miss Clare and Miss Summerson
their rooms. You will like to make some
change, perhaps? You will excuse me, I know,
being so much occupied. O, that very bad child!
Pray put him down, Miss Summerson!"</p>

<p>I begged permission to retain him, truly saying
that he was not at all troublesome; and carried
him up-stairs and laid him on my bed. Ada
and I had two upper rooms, with a door of communication
between. They were excessively
bare and disorderly, and the curtain to my window
was fastened up with a fork.</p>

<p>"You would like some hot water, wouldn't
you?" said Mrs. Jellyby, looking round for a jug
with a handle to it, but looking in vain.</p>

<p>"If it is not being troublesome," said we.
<a class="pagenum" id="page_665" title="pg 665"></a></p>

<p>"O, it's not the trouble," returned Miss Jellyby;
"the question is, if there <i>is</i> any."</p>

<p>The evening was so very cold, and the rooms
had such a marshy smell, that I must confess it
was a little miserable; and Ada was half crying.
We soon laughed, however, and were busily unpacking,
when Miss Jellyby came back to say,
that she was sorry there was no hot water; but
they couldn't find the kettle, and the boiler was
out of order.</p>

<p>We begged her not to mention it, and made
all the haste we could to get down to the fire
again. But all the little children had come up
to the landing outside, to look at the phenomenon
of Peepy lying on my bed; and our attention
was distracted by the constant apparition of
noses and fingers, in situations of danger between
the hinges of the doors. It was impossible to
shut the door of either room; for my lock, with
no knob to it, looked as if it wanted to be wound
up; and though the handle of Ada's went round
and round with the greatest smoothness, it was
attended with no effect whatever on the door.
Therefore I proposed to the children that they
should come in and be very good at my table,
and I would tell them the story of little Red
Riding Hood while I dressed; which they did, and
were as quiet as mice, including Peepy, who awoke
opportunely before the appearance of the wolf.</p>

<p>When we went down stairs we found a mug,
with "A Present from Tunbridge Wells" on it,
lighted up in the staircase window with a floating
wick; and a young woman, with a swelled
face bound up in a flannel bandage, blowing the
fire of the drawing-room (now connected by an
open door with Mrs. Jellyby's room), and choking
dreadfully. It smoked to that degree in short,
that we all sat coughing and crying with the
windows open for half an hour; during which
Mrs. Jellyby, with the same sweetness of temper,
directed letters about Africa. Her being so employed
was, I must say, a great relief to me; for
Richard told us that he had washed his hands in
a pie-dish, and that they had found the kettle on
his dressing-table; and he made Ada laugh so,
that they made me laugh in the most ridiculous
manner.</p>

<p>Soon after seven o'clock we went down to dinner;
carefully, by Mrs. Jellyby's advice; for the
stair-carpets, besides being very deficient in stair-wires,
were so torn as to be absolute traps. We
had a fine cod-fish, a piece of roast beef, a dish
of cutlets, and a pudding; an excellent dinner,
if it had had any cooking to speak of, but it was
almost raw. The young woman with the flannel
bandage waited, and dropped every thing on the
table wherever it happened to go, and never
moved it again until she put it on the stairs.
The person I had seen in pattens (who I suppose
to have been the cook), frequently came and
skirmished with her at the door, and there appeared
to be ill-will between them.</p>

<p>All through dinner; which was long, in consequence
of such accidents as the dish of potatoes
being mislaid in the coal-skuttle, and the
handle of the cork-screw coming off, and striking
the young woman in the chin; Mrs. Jellyby preserved
the evenness of her disposition. She told
us a great deal that was interesting about Borrioboola-Gha
and the natives; and received so
many letters that Richard, who sat by her, saw
four envelopes in the gravy at once. Some of
the letters were proceedings of ladies' committees,
or resolutions of ladies' meetings, which she
read to us; others were applications from people
excited in various ways about the cultivation of
coffee, and natives; others required answers,
and these she sent her eldest daughter from the
table three or four times to write. She was full
of business, and undoubtedly was, as she had
told us, devoted to the cause.</p>

<p>I was a little curious to know who a mild, bald
gentleman in spectacles was, who dropped into
a vacant chair (there was no top or bottom in
particular) after the fish was taken away, and
seemed passively to submit himself to Borrioboola-Gha,
but not to be actively interested in that
settlement. As he never spoke a word, he might
have been a native, but for his complexion. It
was not until we left the table, and he remained
alone with Richard, that the possibility of his
being Mr. Jellyby ever entered my head. But he
was Mr. Jellyby; and a loquacious young man,
called Mr. Quale, with large shining knobs for
temples, and his hair all brushed to the back of
his head, who came in the evening, and told Ada
he was a philanthropist, also informed her that
he called the matrimonial alliance of Mrs. Jellyby
with Mr. Jellyby the union of mind and matter.</p>

<p>This young man, besides having a great deal
to say for himself about Africa, and a project of
his for teaching the coffee colonists to teach the
natives to turn piano-forte legs and establish an
export trade, delighted in drawing Mrs. Jellyby
out by saying, "I believe now, Mrs. Jellyby, you
have received as many as from one hundred and
fifty to two hundred letters respecting Africa in a
single day, have you not?" or, "If my memory
does not deceive me, Mrs. Jellyby, you once mentioned
that you had sent off five thousand circulars
from one post-office at one time?"&mdash;always
repeating Mrs. Jellyby's answer to us, like
an interpreter. During the whole evening, Mr.
Jeilyby sat in a corner with his head against the
wall, as if he were subject to low spirits. It
seemed that he had several times opened his
mouth when alone with Richard, after dinner,
as if he had something on his mind; but had
always shut it again, to Richard's extreme confusion,
without saying any thing.</p>

<p>Mrs. Jellyby, sitting in quite a nest of waste
paper, drank coffee all the evening, and dictated
at intervals to her eldest daughter. She also
held a discussion with Mr. Quale; of which the
subject seemed to be&mdash;if I understood it&mdash;the
Brotherhood of Humanity; and gave utterance
to some beautiful sentiments. I was not so attentive
an auditor as I might have wished to be,
however, for Peepy and the other children came
flocking about Ada and me in a corner of the
<a class="pagenum" id="page_666" title="pg 666"></a>
drawing-room to ask for another story: so we
sat down among them, and told them, in whispers,
Puss in Boots and I don't know what else,
until Mrs. Jellyby, accidentally remembering
them, sent them to bed. As Peepy cried for me
to take him to bed, I carried him up-stairs;
where the young woman with the flannel bandage
charged into the midst of the little family
like a dragoon, and overturned them into cribs.</p>

<p>After that, I occupied myself in making our
room a little tidy, and in coaxing a very cross
fire that had been lighted, to burn; which, at
last, it did, quite brightly. On my return down
stairs, I felt that Mrs. Jellyby looked down upon
me rather, for being so frivolous; and I was sorry
for it; though, at the same time, I knew that I
had no higher pretensions.</p>

<p>It was nearly midnight before we could find
an opportunity of going to bed; and even then we
left Mrs. Jellyby among her papers drinking
coffee, and Miss Jellyby biting the feather of
her pen.</p>

<p>"What a strange house!" said Ada, when we
got up-stairs. "How curious of my cousin Jarndyce
to send us here!"</p>

<p>"My love," said I, "it quite confuses me. I
want to understand it, and I can't understand it
at all."</p>

<p>"What?" asked Ada, with her pretty smile.</p>

<p>"All this, my dear," said I. "It <i>must</i> be
very good of Mrs. Jellyby to take such pains
about a scheme for the benefit of Natives&mdash;and
yet&mdash;Peepy and the housekeeping!"</p>

<p>Ada laughed: and put her arm about my
neck, as I stood looking at the fire; and told me
I was a quiet, dear, good creature, and had won
her heart. "You are so thoughtful, Esther,"
she said, "and yet so cheerful! and you do so
much, so unpretendingly! You would make a
home out of even this house."</p>

<p>My simple darling! She was quite unconscious
that she only praised herself, and that it
was in the goodness of her own heart that she
made so much of me!</p>

<p>"May I ask you a question?" said I, when we
had sat before the fire a little while.</p>

<p>"Five hundred," said Ada.</p>

<p>"Your cousin, Mr. Jarndyce. I owe so much
to him: Would you mind describing him to
me?"</p>

<p>Shaking back her golden hair, Ada turned her
eyes upon me with such laughing wonder, that I
was full of wonder, too&mdash;partly at her beauty,
partly at her surprise.</p>

<p>"Esther!" she cried.</p>

<p>"My dear!"</p>

<p>"You want a description of my cousin, Jarndyce?"</p>

<p>"My dear, I never saw him."</p>

<p>"And <i>I</i> never saw him!" returned Ada.</p>

<p>Well, to be sure!</p>

<p>
o, she had never seen him. Young as she was
when her mamma died, she remembered how
the tears would come into her eyes when she
spoke of him, and of the noble generosity of his
character, which she had said was to be trusted
above all earthly things; and Ada trusted it.
Her cousin, Jarndyce, had written to her a few
months ago&mdash;"a plain, honest letter," Ada said&mdash;proposing
the arrangement we were now to
enter on, and telling her that, "in time, it might
heal some of the wounds made by the miserable
Chancery suit." She had replied, gratefully accepting
his proposal. Richard had received a
similar letter, and had made a similar response.
He <i>had</i> seen Mr. Jarndyce once, but only once,
five years ago, at Winchester school. He had told
Ada, when they were leaning on the screen before
the fire where I found them, that he recollected
him as "a bluff, rosy fellow." This was
the utmost description Ada could give me.</p>

<p>It set me thinking so, that when Ada was
asleep, I still remained before the fire, wondering
and wondering about Bleak House, and wondering
and wondering that yesterday morning should
seem so long ago. I don't know where my thoughts
had wandered, when they were recalled by a tap
at the door.</p>

<p>I opened it softly, and found Miss Jellyby
shivering there, with a broken candle in a broken
candlestick in one hand, and an egg-cup in the
other.</p>

<p>"Good-night!" she said, very sulkily.</p>

<p>"Good-night!" said I.</p>

<p>"May I come in?" she shortly and unexpectedly
asked me, in the same sulky way.</p>

<p>"Certainly," said I. "Don't wake Miss Clare."</p>

<p>She would not sit down, but stood by the fire,
dipping her inky middle finger in the egg-cup,
which contained vinegar, and smearing it over
the ink stains on her face; frowning, the whole
time, and looking very gloomy.</p>

<p>"I wish Africa was dead!" she said, on a
sudden.</p>

<p>I was going to remonstrate.</p>

<p>"I do!" she said. "Don't talk to me, Miss
Summerson. I hate it and detest it. It's a
beast!"</p>

<p>I told her she was tired, and I was sorry. I
put my hand upon her head, and touched her
forehead, and said it was hot now, but would be
cool to-morrow. She still stood, pouting and
frowning at me; but presently put down her
egg-cup, and turned softly toward the bed where
Ada lay.</p>

<p>"She is very pretty!" she said, with the same
knitted brow, and in the same uncivil manner.</p>

<p>I assented with a smile.</p>

<p>"An orphan. Ain't she?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"But knows a quantity, I suppose? Can
dance, and play music, and sing? She can talk
French, I suppose, and do geography, and globes,
and needlework, and every thing?"</p>

<p>"No doubt," said I.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> can't," she returned. "I can't do any
thing hardly, except write. I'm always writing
for Ma. I wonder you two were not ashamed of
yourselves to come in this afternoon, and see me
able to do nothing else. It was like your ill-nature.
<a class="pagenum" id="page_667" title="pg 667"></a>
Yet you think yourselves very fine, I dare
say!"</p>

<div class="figcenter">

title="MISS JELLYBY." />
<p class="center">MISS JELLYBY.</p>
</div>

<p>I could see that the poor girl was near crying,
and I resumed my chair without speaking, and
looked at her (I hope), as mildly as I felt toward
her.</p>

<p>"It's disgraceful," she said. "You know it
is. The whole house is disgraceful. The children
are disgraceful. <i>I</i>'m disgraceful. Pa's
miserable, and no wonder! Priscilla drinks&mdash;she's
always drinking. It's a great shame, and
a great story, of you, if you say you didn't smell
her to-day. It was as bad as a public-house,
waiting at dinner, you know it was!"</p>

<p>"My dear, I don't know it," said I.</p>

<p>"You do," she said, very shortly. "You
sha'n't say you don't. You do!"</p>

<p>"O, my dear!" said I, "if you won't let me speak&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You're speaking now. You know you are.
Don't tell stories, Miss Summerson."</p>

<p>"My dear," said I, "as long as you won't hear
me out&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't want to hear you out."</p>

<p>"O yes, I think you do," said I, "because that
would be so very unreasonable. I did not know
what you tell me, because the servant did not
come near me at dinner; but I don't doubt what
you tell me, and I am sorry to hear it."</p>

<p>"You needn't make a merit of that," said she.</p>

<p>"No, my dear," said I. "That would be very
foolish."</p>

<p>She was still standing by the bed, and now
stooped down (but still with the same discontented
face) and kissed Ada. That done, she
came softly back, and stood by the side of my
chair. Her bosom was heaving in a distressful
manner that I greatly pitied; but I thought it
better not to speak.</p>

<p>"I wish I was dead!" she broke out. "I wish
we were all dead. It would be a great deal better
for us."</p>

<p>"In a moment afterward, she knelt on the
ground at my side, hid her face in my dress, passionately
begged my pardon, and wept. I comforted
her, and would have raised her, but she
cried, No, no; she wanted to stay there!</p>

<p>"You used to teach girls," she said. "If you
<a class="pagenum" id="page_668" title="pg 668"></a>
could only have taught me, I could have learned
from you! I am so very miserable, and I like
you so very much!"</p>

<p>I could not persuade her to sit by me, or to do
any thing but move a ragged stool to where she
was kneeling, and take that, and still hold my
dress in the same manner. By degrees, the poor
tired girl fell asleep; and then I contrived to
raise her head so that it should rest on my lap,
and to cover us both with shawls. The fire went
out, and all night long she slumbered thus before
the ashy grate. At first I was painfully awake,
and vainly tried to lose myself, with, my eyes
closed, among the scenes of the day. At length,
by slow degrees, they became indistinct and
mingled. I began to lose the identity of the
sleeper resting on me. Now, it was Ada; now,
one of my old Reading friends from whom I could
not believe I had so recently parted. Now, it
was the little mad woman worn out with courtesying
and smiling; now, some one in authority
at Bleak House. Lastly, it was no one, and I
was no one.</p>

<p>The purblind day was feebly struggling with
the fog, when I opened my eyes to encounter
those of a dirty-faced little spectre fixed upon
me. Peepy had scaled his crib, and crept down
in his bedgown and cap, and was so cold that his
teeth were chattering as if he had cut them all.</p>

<h2 id="HUNTING_AN_ALLIGATOR">HUNTING AN ALLIGATOR.</h2>

<p class="drop">In the course of the year 1831, the proprietor
of Halahala at Manilla, in the Island of Luconia,
informed me that he frequently lost horses
and cows on a remote part of his plantation, and
that the natives assured him they were taken by
an enormous alligator who frequented one of the
streams which run into the lake. Their descriptions
were so highly wrought, that they were attributed
to the fondness for exaggeration to
which the inhabitants of that country are peculiarly
addicted, and very little credit was given
to their repeated relations. All doubts as to the
existence of the animal were at last dispelled by
the destruction of an Indian, who attempted to
ford the river on horseback, although entreated
to desist by his companions, who crossed at a
shallow place higher up. He reached the centre
of the stream and was laughing at the others for
their prudence, when the alligator came upon
him. His teeth encountered the saddle, which
he tore from the horse, while the rider tumbled
on the other side into the water and made for the
shore. The horse, too terrified to move, stood
trembling where the attack was made. The alligator,
disregarding him, pursued the man, who
safely reached the bank which he could easily
have ascended, but, rendered foolhardy by his
escape, he placed himself behind a tree which
had fallen partly into the water, and drawing his
heavy knife leaned over the tree, and on the approach
of his enemy struck him on the nose.
The animal repeated his assaults and the Indian
his blows, until the former exasperated at the
resistance, rushed on the man and seizing him
by the middle of the body, which was at once
inclosed and crushed in his capacious jaws,
swam into the lake. His friends hastened to the
rescue, but the alligator slowly left the shore,
while the poor wretch, writhing and shrieking in
his agony, with his knife uplifted in his clasped
hands, seemed, as the others expressed it, held
out as a man would carry a torch. His sufferings
were not long continued, for the monster
sank to the bottom, and soon after reappearing
alone on the surface, and calmly basking in the
sun, gave to the horror-stricken spectators the
fullest confirmation of the death and burial of
their comrade.</p>

<p>A short time after this event I made a visit to
Halahala, and expressing a strong desire to capture
or destroy the alligator, my host readily
offered his assistance. The animal had been
seen a few days before, with his head and one
of his fore-feet resting on the bank, and his eyes
following the motions of some cows which were
grazing near. Our informer likened his appearance
to that of a cat watching a mouse, and in
the attitude to spring upon his prey when it
should come within his reach. I may here mention
as a curious fact, that the domestic buffalo,
which is almost continually in the water, and in
the heat of day remains for hours with only his
nose above the surface, is never molested by the
alligator. All other animals become his victims
when they incautiously approach him, and their
knowledge of the danger most usually prompts
them to resort to shallow places to quench their
thirst.</p>

<p>Having heard that the alligator had killed a
horse, we proceeded to the place, about five miles
from the house; it was a tranquil spot and one
of singular beauty even in that land. The stream,
which a few hundred feet from the lake narrowed
to a brook, with its green bank fringed with the
graceful bamboo, and the alternate glory of glade
and forest spreading far and wide, seemed fitted
for other purposes than the familiar haunt of the
huge creature that had appropriated it to himself.
A few cane huts were situated at a short distance
from the river, and we procured from them what
men they contained, who were ready to assist in
freeing themselves from their dangerous neighbor.
The terror which he had inspired, especially
since the death of their companion, had hitherto
prevented them from making an effort to get rid
of him, but they gladly availed themselves of our
preparations, and, with the usual dependence of
their character were willing to do whatever example
should dictate to them. Having reason to
believe that the alligator was in the river, we
commenced operations by sinking nets upright
across its mouth, three deep, at intervals of several
feet. The nets which were of great strength,
and intended for the capture of the buffalo, were
fastened to trees on the banks, making a complete
fence to the communication with the lake.</p>

<p>My companion and myself placed ourselves
with our guns on either side of the stream, while
the Indians with long bamboos felt for the animal.
For some time he refused to be disturbed, and
we began to fear that he was not within our
<a class="pagenum" id="page_669" title="pg 669"></a>
limits, when a spiral motion of the water under
the spot where I was standing, led me to direct
the natives to it, and the creature slowly moved
on the bottom toward the nets, which he no
sooner touched than he quietly turned back and
proceeded up the stream. This movement was
several times repeated, till, having no rest in the
inclosure, he attempted to climb up the bank.
On receiving a ball in the body, he uttered a
growl like that of an angry dog, and plunging
into the water crossed to the other side, where
he was received with a similar salutation, discharged
directly into his mouth. Finding himself
attacked on every side, he renewed his attempts
to ascend the banks; but whatever part
of him appeared was bored with bullets, and
finding that he was hunted, he forgot his own
formidable means of attack, and sought only
safety from the troubles which surrounded him.
A low spot which separated the river from the
lake, a little above the nets, was unguarded, and
we feared that he would succeed in escaping
over it. It was here necessary to stand firmly
against him, and in several attempts which he
made to cross it, we turned him back with spears,
bamboos, or whatever came first to hand. He
once seemed determined to force his way, and
foaming with rage, rushed with open jaws and
gnashing his teeth with a sound too ominous to
be despised, appeared to have his full energies
aroused, when his career was stopped by a large
bamboo thrust violently into his mouth, which
he ground to pieces, and the fingers of the holder
were so paralyzed that for some minutes he was
incapable of resuming his gun. The natives had
now become so excited as to forget all prudence,
and the women and children of the little hamlet
had come down to the shore to share in the
general enthusiasm. They crowded to the opening,
and were so unmindful of their danger that
it was necessary to drive them back with some
violence. Had the monster known his own
strength and dared to have used it, he would
have gone over that spot with a force which no
human power could have withstood, and would
have crushed or carried with him into the lake
about the whole population of the place. It is
not strange that personal safety was forgotten in
the excitement of the scene. The tremendous
brute, galled with wounds and repeated defeat,
tore his way through the foaming water, glancing
from side to side, in the vain attempt to avoid
his foes; then rapidly plowing up the stream
he grounded on the shallows, and turned back
frantic and bewildered at his circumscribed position.
At length, maddened with suffering and
desperate from continued persecution, he rushed
furiously to the mouth of the stream, burst
through two of the nets, and I threw down my
gun in despair, for it looked as though his way
at last was clear to the wide lake; but the third
net stopped him, and his teeth and legs had got
entangled in all. This gave us a chance of closer
warfare with lances, such as are used against the
wild buffalo. We had sent for this weapon at
the commencement of the attack, and found it
much more effectual than guns. Entering the
canoe, we plunged lance after lance into the
alligator, as he was struggling under the water,
till a wood seemed growing from him, which
moved violently above while his body was concealed
below. His endeavors to extricate himself
lashed the waters into foam mingled with
blood, and there seemed no end to his vitality or
decrease to his resistance till a lance struck him
directly through the middle of the back, which
an Indian, with a heavy piece of wood, hammered
into him as he could catch an opportunity. My
companion on the other side now tried to haul
him to the shore, by the nets to which he had
fastened himself, but had not sufficient assistance
with him. As I had more force with me, we
managed, by the aid of the women and children,
to drag his head and part of his body on to the
little beach, and giving him the <i>coup de grace</i>,
left him to gasp out the remnant of his life.</p>

<p>This monster was nearly thirty feet in length
and thirteen feet in circumference, and the head
alone weighed three hundred pounds. On opening
him there were found, with other parts of the
horse, three legs entire, torn off at the haunch
and shoulder, besides a large quantity of stones,
some of them of several pounds' weight.</p>

<span class="i2">The Spanish army lay.</span><br />
Of all Grenada's fortresses<br />
<span class="i2">But one defies their might:</span><br />
On Alphuara's minarets<br />
<span class="i2">The crescent still is bright.</span><br />
Almanzor! King Almanzor!<br />
<span class="i2">All vainly you resist:</span><br />
Your little band is fading fast<br />
<span class="i2">Away like morning mist.</span><br />
A direr foe than ever yet<br />
<span class="i2">They met on battle-plain</span><br />
Assaults life's inmost citadel,<br />
<span class="i2">And heaps the ground with slain.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
One onset more of Spanish ranks&mdash;<br />
<span class="i2">(And soon it will be made!)</span><br />
And Alphuara's towers must reel,<br />
<span class="i2">And in the dust be laid.</span><br />
"And shall the haughty infidel<br />
<span class="i2">Pollute this sacred land?"</span><br />
Almanzor said, as mournfully<br />
<span class="i2">He marked his dwindling band.</span><br />
"Upon our glorious crescent<br />
<span class="i2">Shall the Spaniard set his heel?</span><br />
And is there not one lingering hope?<br />

The victors at the banquet sat,<br />

<span class="i2">Announced a stranger near.</span><br />
From Alphuara had he come.<br />
<span class="i2">With fierce, unwonted speed,</span><br />
And much would it import to Spain<br />
<span class="i2">The news he bore to heed.</span><br />
"Admit him!" cry the revelers;<br />
<span class="i2">And in the pilgrim strode,</span><br />
And throwing off his mantle loose,<br />
<span class="i2">A Moorish habit showed!</span><br />
"Almanzor! King Almanzor!"<br />
<span class="i2">They cried with one acclaim:</span><br />
"Almanzor!" said the Moslem chief&mdash;<br />
<span class="i2">"Almanzor is my name.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
"To serve your prophet and your king,<br />
<span class="i2">Oh, Spaniards! I am here;</span><br />

<span class="i2">This breast has outlived fear!</span><br />
No longer in his creed or cause<br />
<span class="i2">Almanzor can confide;</span><br />
For all the Powers above, 'tis clear,<br />

"Now, welcome, welcome, gallant Moor!"<br />

<p class="stanza">
Right eagerly, to grasp the hands<br />
<span class="i2">Outstretched on every side,</span><br />
Almanzor rushed, and greeted each,<br />
<span class="i2">As bridegroom might his bride;</span><br />
He glued his fevered lips to theirs&mdash;<br />
<span class="i2">He kissed them on the cheek,</span><br />
And breathed on each as if his heart<br />
<span class="i2">Would all its passion wreak.</span><br />
But suddenly his limbs relax,<br />
<span class="i2">A flush comes o'er his face,</span><br />
He reels, as with a pressure faint,<br />
<span class="i2">He gives a last embrace;</span><br />
And livid, purple, grows his skin,<br />
<span class="i2">And wild his eyeballs roll,</span><br />
And some great torture seems to heave<br />
<span class="i2">The life-roots of his soul.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">

<h2 id="A_TASTE_OF_FRENCH_DUNGEONS">A TASTE OF FRENCH DUNGEONS.</h2>

<h3>AN INCIDENT IN THE LIFE OF MRS. RADCLIFFE.</h3>

<p class="drop">Toward the middle of the year 1795, a short
time after the deplorable affair of Quiberon,
an English lady was taken prisoner just as she
was entering France by the Swiss frontier. Her
knowledge of French was limited to a few mispronounced
words. An interpreter was soon
found, and upon his interrogating her as to her
motives for attempting so perilous an enterprise
without passport, she replied that she had exposed
<a class="pagenum" id="page_671" title="pg 671"></a>
herself to all these dangers for the purpose
of visiting the ch&acirc;teau where the barbarous
Sieur de Fayel had made Gabrielle de Vergy eat
the heart of her lover. Such a declaration appeared
so ridiculous to those who heard it that
they were compelled to doubt either the sanity
or the veracity of the strange being who ventured
upon it. They chose to do the latter, and forwarded
the stranger to Paris, with a strong escort,
as an English spy. Upon her arrival there,
she was safely deposited in the Conciergerie.</p>

<p>Public feeling just then ran very high against
the English. The countrywoman of Pitt was
loaded with ill-usage; and her terrors, expressed
in a singular jargon of English mingled with
broken French, served but to augment the coarse
amusement of her jailers. After exhausting
every species of derision and insult upon their
prisoner, they ended by throwing her into the
dampest and most inconvenient dungeon they
could find. The door of this den was not more
than four feet high; and the light that dimly revealed
the dripping walls and earthen floor, came
through a horizontal opening four inches in
height by fifteen in width. The sole movables
of the place consisted of a rope pallet and a
screen.</p>

<p>The bed served for both couch and chair; the
screen was intended as a partial barrier between
the inhabitant of the dungeon and the curious
gaze of the jailers stationed in the adjoining
apartment, who could scrutinize at will, through
a narrow opening between the cells, the slightest
movements of their prisoner.</p>

<p>The stranger recoiled with disgust, and asked
whether they had not a less terrible place in
which to confine a woman.</p>

<p>"You are very bad to please, madame," replied
her brutal jailer, mimicking her defective
French. "You are in the palace of Madame
Capet."</p>

<p>And shutting behind him the massive door,
barricaded with plates of iron and secured by
three or four rusty bolts, he left her, to repeat
his joke to his companion, and enjoy with them
the consternation of Madame <i>Rosbif</i>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the prisoner fell upon her knees, and
gazed around her with a species of pious emotion.</p>

<p>"What right have I," she cried, "to complain
of being cast into this dungeon, once inhabited
by the Queen of France&mdash;the beautiful,
the noble Marie Antoinette? I sought food for
my imagination; I undertook a journey to France
to visit the most celebrated sojourns of the most
celebrated individuals. Fortune has come to
my aid. Here is what is better than the ch&acirc;teau
of the Sieur de Fayel, and the terrible history of
the bleeding heart. Never did a grander inspiration
overflow my spirits. I will to work."</p>

<p>She drew from her pocket a small roll of paper,
that had escaped the scrutiny of the jailers; and,
passing her hand across her forehead, approached
the horizontal opening, in order to make the
most of the little remainder of daylight; then,
taking out a pencil, she rapidly covered ten or
twelve pages with microscopic characters in close
lines. The increasing darkness at length compelled
her to pause, and she was refolding the
MS. to replace it in her pocket, when a rude
hand snatched it from her grasp.</p>

<p>"Ah! ah! Madame Rosbif," cried the jailer,
triumphantly, "so you believe yourself at liberty
to scribble away here, hatching plots against the
Republic, and holding intelligence with the enemies
of the nation. <i>
ous verrons cela!</i> These
papers shall be remitted this very day to Monsieur
Tallien, and we will know all about this
new attack upon liberty. <i>Entendez-vouz?</i> miserable
agent of Pitt and Cobourg."</p>

<p>The same evening Tallien received the stranger's
manuscript. Being unacquainted with the
English language, he rang for his secretary; but
the latter was nowhere at hand, so the puzzled
minister took the papers and proceeded to his
wife's apartments.</p>

<p>Madame Tallien was just completing her toilet
for a fancy ball. Leaning forward in a graceful
attitude, she was in the act of twining round her
slender ankle the fastenings of a purple buskin.
Her Grecian tunic, simply clasped upon the
shoulder with diamonds, and her hair, knotted
like that of the Polyhymnia of the Louvre, harmonized
admirably with the classical contour of
her features. Monsieur Tallien, as he gazed
upon her, half forgot his errand.</p>

<p>The lady uttered a little cry of surprise.</p>

<p>"Upon what grave errand has monsieur deigned
to favor me with a visit at this unaccustomed
hour?"</p>

<p>"I have here some papers," replied the minister,
"that have been seized upon the person
of a female spy, and are said to contain proofs
of a dangerous conspiracy. They are written in
English; my secretary is absent; and I must
ask you to do me the favor to translate them
to me."</p>

<p>Madame Tallien took the MS., and looked it
over.</p>

<p>"Shall I read aloud?" said she, in an amused
tone of voice.</p>

<p>Her husband assented.</p>

<p>"The wind howls mournfully through the
foliage, and the descending rain falls in torrents.
The terrors of my prison become every instant
more fearful. Phantoms arise on every side, and
wave their snowy winding-sheets. Misfortune,
with her cold and pitiless hand, weighs heavily
on my youthful brow.'</p>

<p>"Thus spoke the lovely prisoner, as she groped
with her trembling hands over the humid walls
of the dungeon."</p>

<p>"Here is a singular conspiracy, truly," said
Madame Tallien, as she finished reading the
above. "Let me see the envelope; 'Chapter
XII. The Dungeon of the Ch&acirc;teau.' And the
authoress's name. 'Anne Radcliffe.' <i>Vite, citoyen.</i>
Set this woman at liberty, and bring her
to me. Your spy is no other than the great
English romance-writer, the celebrated authoress
of the 'Mysteries of Udolpho!"</p>

<p>Tallien now recalled the romantic intention
of the stranger's hazardous journey, as confessed
<a class="pagenum" id="page_672" title="pg 672"></a>
by herself; perceived the mistake of his agents,
and laughed heartily. Going quickly out, he
issued orders for the immediate liberation of the
prisoner, and desired the messenger to bring
her straight to the presence of Madame Tallien.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the beautiful Frenchwoman, forgetting
her toilet and the ball, paced the apartment
with almost childish delight and impatience.
She was about to make the acquaintance&mdash;in a
manner the most piquant and unexpected&mdash;of
the authoress of those romances which had so
often filled her vivid imagination with ideas of
apparitions, and prisoners dying of hunger in
horrible dungeons. She consulted her watch
perpetually, and counted the very seconds. At
length there was a sound of carriage-wheels in
the court-yard of the hotel. Madame Tallien
rushed to the door; it opened, and the two celebrated
females stood face to face.</p>

<p>The minister's wife could not avoid recoiling
with surprise, and some degree of consternation,
before the singular figure that paused in the
open doorway; for Mrs. Radcliffe had stopped
short, dazzled and bewildered by the lights of
the saloon, which wounded eyes accustomed for
some hours past to the humid obscurity of a
dungeon. The English authoress presented a
striking contrast to the radiant being before her.
Dry, cold, and angular, her attire necessarily in
some degree of disorder from her arrest, forced
journey, and imprisonment, her whole aspect had
in it something <i>bizarre</i> and fantastic, that added
to her age at least ten years.</p>

<p>A little recovered from her first surprise, Madame
Tallien advanced toward the stranger, gave
her a cordial welcome in English, and told her
how happy she esteemed herself in having been
the means of setting at liberty so celebrated an
authoress. The Englishwoman made a polite
reply to this compliment, and then they seated
themselves before the fire, whose clear flame
and vivifying heat were very welcome to the
liberated prisoner, and quickly restored an activity
of mind that appeared to have been benumbed
by the coldness of her dungeon. The
ensuing conversation was gay, piquant, full of
charm and <i>abandon</i>, and was only interrupted
by the orders given by Madame Tallien to her
<i>femme de chambre</i> to send the carriage away,
and deny her to all visitors.</p>

<p>Mrs. Radcliffe had traveled much, and related
her adventures with grace and originality. Hours
flew by unheeded, and the Englishwoman was
in the very midst of some bold enterprise of her
journey in Switzerland, when the time-piece
struck twelve. She turned pale, and a visible
shuddering seized her. Then pausing in her
tale, she looked wildly and fearfully around, as
if following the movements of some invisible
being. Madame Tallien, struck with a species
of vague terror, dared not address a single word
to her visitor. The latter at length abruptly
rose, opened the door, and with an imperative
gesture ordered some one by the name of Henry
to leave the room, after which she appeared to
experience a sudden relief.</p>

<p>The lovely Frenchwoman, with the tact of real
kindness, appeared not to notice this strange
incident, and the new-made friends soon after
separated, Madame Tallien herself conducting
her guest to the apartment provided for her,
where she took leave of her with an affectionate
"<i>au revoir!</i>"</p>

<p>The following evening Mrs. Radcliffe appeared
in her hostess's saloon, as soon as the latter had
signified that she was ready to receive her.
Calm and composed, habited <i>a la Fran&ccedil;aise</i>, the
English romancist appeared ten years younger
than she had done the evening before, and was
even not without a certain degree of beauty.
She said not a word on the scene of the preceding
evening; was gay, witty, amiable, and
took an animated part in the conversation that
followed. But as soon as the minute-hand of
the time-piece pointed to half-past eleven, her
color fled, a shade of pensiveness replaced her
former gayety, and a few moments afterward
she took her leave of the company.</p>

<p>The same thing happened the next day, and
every ensuing evening. Madame Tallien could
not avoid a feeling of curiosity, but she had too
much politeness to question the stranger confided
to her hospitality. In this way a month
elapsed, at the end of which time Mrs. Radcliffe
could not avoid expressing, one evening when
she found herself alone with her new friend, her
disappointment at being detained a prisoner in
France, without the power of returning to her
own country. Upon this Madame Tallien rose,
took a paper from a desk, and handed it to the
Englishwoman. It was a passport dated from
the same evening that Mrs. Radcliffe had been
liberated from her dungeon.</p>

<p>"Since you wish to leave your French friends,"
said her lovely hostess, smiling, "go, ingrate!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, not ungrateful!" replied the authoress,
taking the beautiful hands of her friend, and
carrying them to her lips; "but the year is fast
waning, and a solemn duty recalls me to my
native land. In the church-yard of a poor village
near London are two tombs, which I visit
each Christmas-day with flowers and prayers.
If I return not before then, this will be the first
time for five years that they have been neglected.
You already know all my other secrets,"
she continued, lowering her voice; "it is my
intention to confide this secret also to your
friendly ears." Passing her hand across her
brow, the Englishwoman then proceeded to relate
a strange and tragic tale, for the particulars
of which we have not space in our limited sketch.
Suffice it to say, that it had left our authoress
subject to a distressing and obstinate spectral
illusion. In the reality of this appearance she
firmly believed, not having sufficient knowledge
of science to attribute her visitation to its true
origin&mdash;a partial disarrangement of the nervous
system. This visitation regularly recurred at
midnight, and at once accounted for the singular
behavior that had so piqued the benevolent
Frenchwoman's curiosity.</p>

<p>Mrs. Radcliffe now returned to London, where
<a class="pagenum" id="page_673" title="pg 673"></a>
she shortly afterward published "The Italian, or
the Confessional of the Black Penitents."</p>

<p>We can, in our day, realize to ourselves very
little of the effect produced by Anne Radcliffe's
romances at the time of their appearance. All
the contemporary critics agree in testifying to
their immense success, only inferior to that of
the Waverley novels in more recent times. Now
they appear nothing more than the efflux of a
morbid imagination, full of hallucinations and
absurdities, and insufferably tedious to our modern
tastes, accustomed to the condensed writing
of the present day. Their unconnected plots
are nevertheless not altogether devoid of a certain
sort of interest, and are fraught with picturesque
situations and melodramatic surprises.
The living characters therein introduced present
few natural features. We recognize every where
the caprices of an unbridled fancy, and a prevailing
vitiation of sense and taste.</p>

<p>Anne Radcliffe died near London, on the 7th
February, 1823, at the age of 63. The "New
Monthly Magazine," for May of that year, announces
her decease, and affirms that her death
was accompanied by singular visions, which had
pursued her ever since a romantic event of her
youth.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Continued.</span></h3>

<p>"Your flatterers will tell you, Signorina, that
you are much improved since then, but I
liked you better as you were; not but what I
hope to return some day what you then so generously
pressed upon me."</p>

<p>"Pressed upon you!&mdash;I? Signor, you are under
some strange mistake."</p>

<p>"Alas! no; but the female heart is so capricious
and fickle! You pressed it upon me, I assure
you. I own that I was not loth to accept
it."</p>

<p>"Pressed it? Pressed, what?"</p>

<p>"Your kiss, my child," said Harley; and
then added with a serious tenderness, "And I
again say that I hope to return it some day&mdash;when
I see you, by the side of father and of husband,
in your native land&mdash;the fairest bride on
whom the skies of Italy ever smiled! And now,
pardon a hermit and a soldier for his rude jests,
and give your hand in token of that pardon, to&mdash;Harley
L'Estrange."</p>

<p>Violante, who at the first words of this address
had recoiled, with a vague belief that the stranger
was out of his mind, sprang forward as it
closed, and in all the vivid enthusiasm of her nature,
pressed the hand held out to her, with both
her own. "Harley L'Estrange&mdash;the preserver
of my father's life!" she cried, and her eyes
were fixed on his with such evident gratitude
and reverence, that Harley felt at once confused
and delighted. She did not think at that instant
of the hero of her dreams&mdash;she thought but of
him who had saved her father. But, as his eyes
sank before her own, and his head, uncovered,
bowed over the hand he held, she recognized
the likeness to the features on which she had so
often gazed. The first bloom of youth was gone,
but enough of youth still remained to soften the
lapse of years, and to leave to manhood the attractions
which charm the eye. Instinctively
she withdrew her hands from his clasp, and, in
her turn, looked down.</p>

<p>In this pause of embarrassment to both, Riccabocca
let himself into the garden by his own
latch-key, and, startled to see a man by the side
of Violante, sprang forward with an abrupt and
angry cry. Harley heard, and turned.</p>

<p>As if restored to courage and self-possession
by the sense of her father's presence, Violante
again took the hand of the visitor. "Father,"
she said, simply, "it is he&mdash;<i>he</i> is come at last."
And then, retiring a few steps, she contemplated
them both; and her face was radiant with happiness&mdash;as
if something, long silently missed and
looked for, was as silently found, and life had no
more a want, nor the heart a void.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Book X.</span>&mdash;INITIAL CHAPTER.</h3>

<p>It is observed by a very pleasant writer&mdash;read
nowadays only by the brave, pertinacious few
who still struggle hard to rescue from the House
of Pluto the souls of departed authors, jostled
and chased as those souls are by the noisy footsteps
of the living&mdash;it is observed by the admirable
Charron, that "judgment and wisdom is
not only the best, but the happiest portion God
Almighty hath distributed among men; for
though this distribution be made with a very uneven
hand, yet nobody thinks himself stinted or
ill-dealt with, but he that hath never so little is
contented in <i>this</i> respect."<sup><a href="#fn6" id="r6">[6]</a></sup></p>

<p>And, certainly, the present narrative may serve
in notable illustration of the remark so drily made
by the witty and wise preacher. For whether
our friend Riccabocca deduce theories for daily
life from the great folio of Machiavel; or that
promising young gentleman, Mr. Randal Leslie,
interpret the power of knowledge into the art of
being too knowing for dull honest folks to cope
with him; or acute Dick Avenel push his way
up the social ascent with a blow for those before,
and a kick for those behind him, after the approved
fashion of your strong New Man; or Baron
Levy&mdash;that cynical impersonation of Gold&mdash;compare
himself to the Magnetic Rock in the Arabian
tale, to which the nails in every ship that approaches
the influence of the loadstone fly from
the planks, and a shipwreck per day adds its
waifs to the Rock: questionless, at least, it is,
that each of these personages believed that Providence
had bestowed on him an elder son's inheritance
of wisdom. Nor, were we to glance
toward the obscurer paths of life, should we find
<a class="pagenum" id="page_674" title="pg 674"></a>
good Parson Dale deem himself worse off than
the rest of the world in this precious commodity&mdash;as,
indeed, he had signally evinced of late in
that shrewd guess of his touching Professor Moss;
even plain Squire Hazeldean took it for granted
that he could teach Audley Egerton a thing or
two worth knowing in politics; Mr. Stirn thought
that there was no branch of useful lore on which
he could not instruct the squire; and Sprott, the
tinker, with his bag full of tracts and lucifer
matches, regarded the whole framework of modern
society, from a rick to a constitution, with
the profound disdain of a revolutionary philosopher.
Considering that every individual thus
brings into the stock of the world so vast a share
of intelligence, it can not but excite our wonder
to find that Oxenstiern is popularly held to be
right when he said, "See, my son, how little
wisdom it requires to govern states;"&mdash;that is,
Men! That so many millions of persons each
with a profound assurance that he is possessed
of an exalted sagacity, should concur in the ascendency
of a few inferior intellects, according to
a few stupid, prosy, matter-of-fact rules as old
as the hills, is a phenomenon very discreditable
to the spirit and energy of the aggregate human
species! It creates no surprise that one sensible
watch-dog should control the movements of a
flock of silly, grass-eating sheep; but that two
or three silly, grass-eating sheep should give the
law to whole flocks of such mighty sensible watch-dog&mdash;<i>Diavolo!</i>
Dr. Riccabocca, explain <i>that</i> if
you can! And wonderfully strange it is, that
notwithstanding all the march of enlightenment,
notwithstanding our progressive discoveries in
the laws of nature&mdash;our railways, steam engines,
animal magnetism, and electro-biology&mdash;we have
never made any improvement that is generally
acknowledged, since Men ceased to be troglodytes
and nomads, in the old-fashioned gamut of flats
and sharps, which attunes into irregular social
jog-trot all the generations that pass from the
cradle to the grave; still, "<i>the desire for something
we have not</i>" impels all the energies that
keep us in movement, for good for ill, according
to the checks or the directions of each favorite
desire.</p>

<p>A friend of mine once said to a <i>millionaire</i>,
whom he saw forever engaged in making money
which he never seemed to have any pleasure in
spending, "Pray, Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, will you answer me
one question: You are said to have two millions,
and you spend &pound;600 a year. In order to rest
and enjoy, what will content you?"</p>

<p>"A little more," answered the <i>millionaire</i>.
That "little more" is the mainspring of civilization.
Nobody ever gets it!</p>

<p>"Philus," saith a Latin writer, "was not so
rich as L&aelig;lius; L&aelig;lius was not so rich as Scipio;
Scipio was not so rich as Crassus; and Crassus
was not so rich&mdash;as he wished to be!" If John
Bull were once contented, Manchester might shut
up its mills. It is the "little more" that makes
a mere trifle of the National Debt!&mdash;Long life
to it!</p>

<p>Still, mend our law-books as we will, one is
forced to confess that knaves are often seen in
fine linen, and honest men in the most shabby
old rags; and still, notwithstanding the exceptions,
knavery is a very hazardous game; and
honesty, on the whole, by far the best policy.
Still, most of the Ten Commandments remain at
the core of all the Pandects and Institutes that
keep our hands off our neighbors' throats, wives,
and pockets; still, every year shows that the
Parson's maxim&mdash;<i>quieta non movere</i>&mdash;is as prudent
for the health of communities as when Apollo
recommended his votaries not to rake up a fever
by stirring the Lake Camarina; still people,
thank Heaven, decline to reside in parallelograms;
and the surest token that we live under a free
government is, when we are governed by persons
whom we have a full right to imply, by our censure
and ridicule, are blockheads compared to
ourselves! Stop that delightful privilege, and,
by Jove! sir, there is neither pleasure nor honor
in being governed at all! You might as well be&mdash;a
Frenchman.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p>The Italian and his friend are closeted together.</p>

<p>"And why have you left your home in &mdash;&mdash;shire?
and why this new change of name?"</p>

<p>"Peschiera is in England."</p>

<p>"I know it."</p>

<p>"And bent on discovering me; and, it is said,
of stealing from me my child."</p>

<p>"He has had the assurance to lay wagers that
he will win the hand of your heiress. I know that
too; and therefore I have come to England&mdash;first
to baffle his design&mdash;for I do not think your
fears are exaggerated&mdash;and next to learn from
you how to follow up a clew which, unless I am
too sanguine, may lead to his ruin, and your unconditional
restoration. Listen to me. You are
aware that, after the skirmish with Peschiera's
armed hirelings, sent in search of you, I received
a polite message from the Austrian government,
requesting me to leave its Italian domains.
Now, as I hold it the obvious duty of any foreigner,
admitted to the hospitality of a state, to refrain
from all participation in its civil disturbances,
so I thought my honor assailed at this intimation,
and went at once to Vienna to explain
to the Minister there (to whom I was personally
known), that though I had, as became man to
man, aided to protect a refugee, who had taken
shelter under my roof, from the infuriated soldiers
at the command of his private foe, I had not only
not shared in any attempt at revolt, but dissuaded,
as far as I could, my Italian friends from their
enterprise; and that because, without discussing
its merits, I believed, as a military man and a
cool spectator, the enterprise could only terminate
in fruitless bloodshed. I was enabled to establish
my explanation by satisfactory proof;
and my acquaintance with the Minister assumed
something of the character of friendship. I was
then in a position to advocate your cause, and to
state your original reluctance to enter into the
<a class="pagenum" id="page_675" title="pg 675"></a>
plots of the insurgents. I admitted freely that
you had such natural desire for the independence
of your native land, that, had the standard of
Italy been boldly hoisted by its legitimate chiefs,
or at the common uprising of its whole people,
you would have been found in the van, amidst
the ranks of your countrymen; but I maintained
that you would never have shared in a conspiracy
frantic in itself, and defiled by the lawless
schemes and sordid ambition of its main projectors,
had you not been betrayed and decoyed into
it by the misrepresentations and domestic treachery
of your kinsman&mdash;the very man who denounced
you. Unfortunately, of this statement
I had no proof but your own word. I made,
however, so far an impression in your favor, and,
it may be, against the traitor, that your property
was not confiscated to the State, nor handed over,
upon the plea of your civil death, to your kinsman."</p>

<p>"How!&mdash;I do not understand. Peschiera has
the property?"</p>

<p>"He holds the revenues but of one-half upon
pleasure, and they would be withdrawn, could I
succeed in establishing the case that exists against
him. I was forbidden before to mention this to
you; the Minister, not inexcusably, submitted you
to the probation of unconditional exile. Your
grace might depend upon your own forbearance
from farther conspiracies&mdash;forgive the word. I
need not say I was permitted to return to Lombardy.
I found, on my arrival, that&mdash;that your
unhappy wife had been to my house, and exhibited
great despair at hearing of my departure."</p>

<p>Riccabocca knit his dark brows, and breathed
hard.</p>

<p>"I did not judge it necessary to acquaint you
with this circumstance, nor did it much affect me.
I believed in her guilt&mdash;and what could now avail
her remorse, if remorse she felt? Shortly afterward,
I heard that she was no more."</p>

<p>"Yes," muttered Riccabocca, "she died in the
same year that I left Italy. It must be a strong
reason that can excuse a friend for reminding me
even that she once lived!"</p>

<p>"I come at once to that reason," said L'Estrange,
gently. "This autumn I was roaming
through Switzerland, and, in one of my pedestrian
excursions amidst the mountains, I met with an
accident, which confined me for some days to a
sofa at a little inn in an obscure village. My
hostess was an Italian; and, as I had left my
servant at a town at some distance, I required
her attention till I could write to him to come to
me. I was thankful for her cares, and amused
by her Italian babble. We became very good
friends. She told me she had been servant to
a lady of great rank, who had died in Switzerland;
and that, being enriched by the generosity
of her mistress, she had married a Swiss innkeeper,
and his people had become hers. My servant
arrived, and my hostess learned my name, which
she did not know before. She came into my room
greatly agitated. In brief, this woman had been
servant to your wife. She had accompanied her
to my villa, and known of her anxiety to see me,
as your friend. The government had assigned to
your wife your palace at Milan, with a competent
income. She had refused to accept of either.
Failing to see me, she had set off toward England,
resolved, upon seeing yourself; for the journals had
stated that to England you had escaped."</p>

<p>"She dared!&mdash;shameless! And see, but a moment
before, I had forgotten all but her grave in
a foreign soil&mdash;and these tears had forgiven her,"
murmured the Italian.</p>

<p>"Let them forgive her still," said Harley, with
all his exquisite sweetness of look and tone. "I
resume. On entering Switzerland, your wife's
health, which you know was always delicate, gave
way. To fatigue and anxiety succeeded fever,
and delirium ensued. She had taken with her but
this one female attendant&mdash;the sole one she could
trust&mdash;on leaving home. She suspected Peschiera
to have bribed her household. In the presence
of this woman she raved of her innocence&mdash;in
accents of terror and aversion, denounced your
kinsman&mdash;and called on you to vindicate her name
and your own."</p>

<p>"Ravings indeed! Poor Paulina!" groaned
Riccabocca, covering his face with both hands.</p>

<p>"But in her delirium there were lucid intervals.
In one of these she rose, in spite of all her servant
could do to restrain her, took from her desk several
letters, and reading them over, exclaimed
piteously, 'But how to get them to him?&mdash;whom
to trust? And his friend is gone!' Then an idea
seemed suddenly to flash upon her, for she uttered
a joyous exclamation, sate down, and wrote
long and rapidly; inclosed what she wrote with
all the letters, in one packet, which she sealed
carefully, and bade her servant carry to the post,
with many injunctions to take it with her own
hand, and pay the charge on it. 'For, oh!' said
she (I repeat the words as my informant told
them to me)&mdash;'for, oh, this is my sole chance to
prove to my husband that, though I have erred,
I am not the guilty thing he believes me; the sole
chance, too, to redeem my error, and restore, perhaps,
to my husband his country, to my child her
heritage.' The servant took the letter to the post;
and when she returned, her lady was asleep, with
a smile upon her face. But from that sleep she
woke again delirious, and before the next morning
her soul had fled." Here Riccabocca lifted
one hand from his face, and grasped Harley's arm,
as if mutely beseeching him to pause. The heart
of the man struggled hard with his pride and his
philosophy; and it was long before Harley could
lead him to regard the worldly prospects which
this last communication from his wife might open
to his ruined fortunes. Not, indeed, till Riccabocca
had persuaded himself, and half persuaded
Harley (for strong, indeed, was all presumption
of guilt against the dead), that his wife's protestations
of innocence from all but error had been
but ravings.</p>

<p>"Be this as it may," said Harley, "there
seems every reason to suppose that the letters inclosed
were Peschiera's correspondence, and that,
<a class="pagenum" id="page_676" title="pg 676"></a>
if so, these would establish the proof of his influence
over your wife, and of his perfidious machinations
against yourself. I resolved, before coming
hither, to go round by Vienna. There I heard
with dismay that Peschiera had not only obtained
the imperial sanction to demand your daughter's
hand, but had boasted to his profligate circle
that he should succeed; and he was actually on
his road to England. I saw at once that could
this design, by any fraud or artifice, be successful
with Violante (for of your consent, I need not say,
I did not dream), the discovery of this packet,
whatever its contents, would be useless: his end
would be secured. I saw also that his success
would suffice forever to clear his name; for his
success must imply your consent (it would be to
disgrace your daughter, to assert that she had
married without it), and your consent would be
his acquittal. I saw, too, with alarm, that to all
means for the accomplishment of his project he
would be urged by despair; for his debts are
great, and his character nothing but new wealth
can support. I knew that he was able, bold, determined,
and that he had taken with him a large
supply of money, borrowed upon usury;&mdash;in a
word, I trembled for you both. I have now seen
your daughter, and I tremble no more. Accomplished
seducer as Peschiera boasts himself, the
first look upon her face, so sweet, yet so noble,
convinced me that she is proof against a legion
of Peschieras. Now, then, return we to this all-important
subject&mdash;to this packet. It never
reached you. Long years have passed since then.
Does it exist still? Into whose hands would it
have fallen? Try to summon up all your recollections.
The servant could not remember the
name of the person to whom it was addressed;
she only insisted that the name began with a B,
that it was directed to England, and that to England
she accordingly paid the postage. Whom,
then, with a name that begins with B, or (in case
the servant's memory here mislead her) whom did
you or your wife know, during your visit to England,
with sufficient intimacy to make it probable
that she would select such a person for her confidante?"</p>

<p>"I cannot conceive," said Riccabocca, shaking
his head. "We came to England shortly after our
marriage. Paulina was affected by the climate.
She spoke not a word of English, and indeed not
even French as might have been expected from
her birth, for her father was poor, and thoroughly
Italian. She refused all society. I went, it is
true, somewhat into the London world&mdash;enough
to induce me to shrink from the contrast that my
second visit as a beggared refugee would have
made to the reception I met with on my first&mdash;but
I formed no intimate friendships. I recall
no one whom she could have written to as intimate
with me."</p>

<p>"But," persisted Harley, "think again. Was
there no lady well acquainted with Italian, and
with whom, perhaps, for that very reason, your
wife become familiar?"</p>

<p>"Ah, it is true. There was one old lady of
retired habits, but who had been much in Italy.
Lady&mdash;Lady&mdash;I remember&mdash;Lady Jane Horton."</p>

<p>"Horton&mdash;Lady Jane!" exclaimed Harley;
"again! thrice in one day&mdash;is this wound never
to scar over?" Then, noting Riccabocca's look
of surprise, he said, "Excuse me, my friend; I
listen to you with renewed interest. Lady Jane
was a distant relation of my own; she judged
me, perhaps, harshly&mdash;and I have some painful
associations with her name; but she was a woman
of many virtues. Your wife knew her?"</p>

<p>"Not, however, intimately&mdash;still, better than
any one else in London. But Paulina would not
have written to her; she knew that Lady Jane
had died shortly after her own departure from
England. I myself was summoned back to Italy
on pressing business; she was too unwell to journey
with me as rapidly as I was obliged to travel;
indeed, illness detained her several weeks in England.
In this interval she might have made
acquaintances. Ah, now I see; I guess. You
say the name began with B. Paulina, in my
absence, engaged a companion; it was at my
suggestion&mdash;a Mrs. Bertram. This lady accompanied
her abroad. Paulina became excessively
attached to her, she knew Italian so well. Mrs.
Bertram left her on the road, and returned to
England, for some private affairs of her own. I
forget why or wherefore; if, indeed, I ever asked
or learned. Paulina missed her sadly, often talked
of her, wondered why she never heard from her.
No doubt it was to this Mrs. Bertram that she
wrote!"</p>

<p>"And you don't know the lady's friends or
address?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Nor who recommended her to your wife?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Probably Lady Jane Horton?"</p>

<p>"It may be so. Very likely."</p>

<p>"I will follow up this track, slight as it is."</p>

<p>"But if Mrs. Bertram received the communication,
how comes it that it never reached&mdash;O,
fool that I am, how should it! I, who guarded
so carefully my incognito!"</p>

<p>"True. This your wife could not foresee; she
would naturally imagine that your residence in
England would be easily discovered. But many
years must have passed since your wife lost sight
of this Mrs. Bertram, if their acquaintance was
made so soon after your marriage; and now it is
a long time to retrace&mdash;long before even your
Violante was born."</p>

<p>"Alas! yes. I lost two fair sons in the interval.
Violante was born to me as the child of
sorrow."</p>

<p>"And to make sorrow lovely! how beautiful
she is!"</p>

<p>The father smiled proudly.</p>

<p>"Where, in the loftiest houses of Europe, find
a husband worthy of such a prize?"</p>

<p>"You forget that I am still an exile&mdash;she still
dowerless. You forget that I am pursued by
Peschiera; that I would rather see her a beggar's
wife&mdash;than&mdash;Pah, the very thought maddens me,
<a class="pagenum" id="page_677" title="pg 677"></a>
it is so foul, <i>Corpo di Bacco</i>! I have been glad
to find her a husband already."</p>

<p>"Already! Then that young man spoke
truly?"</p>

<p>"What young man?"</p>

<p>"Randal Leslie. How! You know him?"
Here a brief explanation followed. Harley heard
with attentive ear, and marked vexation, the particulars
of Riccabocca's connection and implied
engagement with Leslie.</p>

<p>"There is something very suspicious to me in
all this," said he. "Why should this young
man have so sounded me as to Violante's chance
of losing a fortune if she married an Englishman?"</p>

<p>"Did he? Oh, pooh! excuse him. It was
but his natural wish to seem ignorant of all
about me. He did not know enough of my intimacy
with you to betray my secret."</p>

<p>"But he knew enough of it&mdash;must have known
enough to have made it right that he should tell
you I was in England. He does not seem to have
done so."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;<i>that</i> is strange&mdash;yet scarcely strange;
for, when we last met, his head was full of other
things&mdash;love and marriage. <i>Basta!</i> youth will
be youth."</p>

<p>"He has no youth left in him!" exclaimed
Harley, passionately. "I doubt if he ever had
any. He is one of those men who come into the
world with the pulse of a centenarian. You and
I never shall be as old&mdash;as he was in long-clothes.
Ah, you may laugh; but I am never wrong in
my instincts. I disliked him at the first&mdash;his
eye, his smile, his voice, his very footstep. It is
madness in you to countenance such a marriage:
it may destroy all chance of your restoration."</p>

<p>"Better that than infringe my word once
passed."</p>

<p>"No, no," exclaimed Harley; "your word is
not passed&mdash;it shall not be passed. Nay, never
look so piteously at me. At all events, pause
till we know more of this young man. If he be
worthy of her without a dower, why, then, let
him lose you your heritage. I should have no
more to say."</p>

<p>"But why lose me my heritage!"</p>

<p>"Do you think the Austrian government would
suffer your estates to pass to this English jackanapes,
a clerk in a public office? Oh, sage in
theory, why are you such a simpleton in action!"</p>

<p>
othing moved by this taunt, Riccabocca
rubbed his hands, and then stretched them
comfortably over the fire.</p>

<p>"My friend," said he, "the heritage would
pass to my son&mdash;a dowry only goes to the daughter."</p>

<p>"But you have no son."</p>

<p>"Hush! I am going to have one; my Jemima
informed me of it yesterday morning; and it
was upon that information that I resolved to
speak to Leslie. Am I a simpleton now?"</p>

<p>"Going to have a son," repeated Harley, looking
very bewildered; "how do you know it is to
be a son?"</p>

<p>"Physiologists are agreed," said the sage, positively,
"that where the husband is much older
than the wife, and there has been a long interval
without children before she condescends to increase
the population of the world&mdash;she (that is,
it is at least as nine to four)&mdash;she brings into the
world a male. I consider that point, therefore,
as settled, according to the calculations of statistics
and the researches of naturalists."</p>

<p>Harley could not help laughing, though he was
still angry and disturbed.</p>

<p>"The same man as ever; always the fool of
philosophy."</p>

<p>"<i>Cospetto!</i>" said Riccabocca, "I am rather
the philosopher of fools. And talking of that,
shall I present you to my Jemima?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but in turn I must present you to one
who remembers with gratitude your kindness,
and whom your philosophy, for a wonder, has not
ruined. Some time or other you must explain
that to me. Excuse me for a moment; I will go
for him."</p>

<p>"For him&mdash;for whom? In my position I must
be cautious; and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I will answer for his faith and discretion.
Meanwhile, order dinner, and let me and my
friend stay to share it."</p>

<p>"Dinner? <i>Corpo di Bacco!</i>&mdash;not that Bacchus
can help us here. What will Jemima say?"</p>

<p>"Henpecked man, settle that with your connubial
tyrant. But dinner it must be."</p>

<p>I leave the reader to imagine the delight of
Leonard at seeing once more Riccabocca unchanged,
and Violante so improved; and the
kind Jemima, too. And their wonder at him
and his history, his books and his fame. He
narrated his struggles and adventures with a
simplicity that removed from a story so personal
the character of egotism. But when he came to
speak of Helen, he was brief and reserved.</p>

<p>Violante would have questioned more closely;
but, to Leonard's relief, Harley interposed.</p>

<p>"You shall see her whom he speaks of, before
long, and question her yourself."</p>

<p>With these words, Harley turned the young
man's narrative into new directions; and Leonard's
words again flowed freely. Thus the evening
passed away happily to all save Riccabocca.
But the thought of his dead wife rose ever and
anon before him; and yet when it did, and became
too painful, he crept nearer to Jemima, and
looked in her simple face, and pressed her cordial
hand. And yet the monster had implied to Harley
that his comforter was a fool&mdash;so she was, to
love so contemptible a slanderer of herself, and
her sex.</p>

<p>Violante was in a state of blissful excitement;
she could not analyze her own joy. But her conversation
was chiefly with Leonard; and the
most silent of all was Harley. He sate listening
to Leonard's warm, yet unpretending eloquence&mdash;that
eloquence which flows so naturally from
genius, when thoroughly at its ease, and not
chilled back on itself by hard unsympathizing
hearers&mdash;listened, yet more charmed, to the sentiments
<a class="pagenum" id="page_678" title="pg 678"></a>
less profound, yet no less earnest&mdash;sentiments
so feminine, yet so noble, with which
Violante's fresh virgin heart responded to the
poet's kindling soul. Those sentiments of hers
were so unlike all he heard in the common world&mdash;so
akin to himself in his gone youth! Occasionally&mdash;at
some high thought of her own, or
some lofty line from Italian song, that she cited
with lighted eyes, and in melodious accents&mdash;occasionally
he reared his knightly head, and his lips
quivered, as if he had heard the sound of a trumpet.
The inertness of long years was shaken.
The Heroic, that lay deep beneath all the humors
of his temperament, was reached, appealed to;
and stirred within him, rousing up all the bright
associations connected with it, and long dormant.
When he rose to take leave, surprised at the lateness
of the hour, Harley said, in a tone that bespoke
the sincerity of the compliment, "I thank
you for the happiest hours I have known for
years." His eye dwelt on Violante as he spoke.
But timidity returned to her with his words&mdash;at
his look; and it was no longer the inspired muse,
but the bashful girl that stood before him.</p>

<p>"And when shall I see you again?" asked
Riccabocca disconsolately, following his guest to
the door.</p>

<p>"When? Why, of course, to-morrow. Adieu!
my friend. No wonder you have borne your exile
so patiently&mdash;with such a child!"</p>

<p>He took Leonard's arm, and walked with him
to the inn where he had left his horse. Leonard
spoke of Violante with enthusiasm. Harley was
silent.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p>The next day a somewhat old-fashioned, but
exceedingly patrician equipage stopped at Riccabocca's
garden-gate. Giacomo, who, from a
bedroom window, had caught sight of it winding
toward the house, was seized with undefinable
terror when he beheld it pause before their walls
and heard the shrill summons at the portal. He
rushed into his master's presence, and implored
him not to stir&mdash;not to allow any one to give ingress
to the enemies the machine might disgorge.
"I have heard," said he, "how a town in Italy&mdash;I
think it was Bologna&mdash;was once taken and
given to the sword, by incautiously admitting a
wooden horse, full of the troops of Barbarossa,
and all manner of bombs and Congreve rockets."</p>

<p>"The story is differently told in Virgil," quoth
Riccabocca, peeping out of the window. "Nevertheless,
the machine looks very large and suspicious;
unloose Pompey!"</p>

<p>"Father," said Violante, coloring, "it is your
friend Lord L'Estrange; I hear his voice."</p>

<p>"Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"Quite. How can I be mistaken?"</p>

<p>"Go, then, Giacomo; but take Pompey with
thee&mdash;and give the alarm, if we are deceived."</p>

<p>But Violante was right; and in a few moments
Lord L'Estrange was seen walking up the garden,
and giving the arm to two ladies.</p>

<p>"All," said Riccabocca, composing his dressing-robe
round him, "go, my child, and summon
Jemima. Man to man; but, for Heaven's, sake
woman to-woman."</p>

<p>Harley had brought his mother and Helen, in
compliment to the ladies of his friend's household.</p>

<p>The proud countess knew that she was in the
presence of Adversity, and her salute to Riccabocca
was only less respectful than that with which
she would have rendered homage to her sovereign.
But Riccabocca, always gallant to the sex that
he pretended to despise, was not to be outdone
in ceremony; and the bow which replied to the
courtesy would have edified the rising generation,
and delighted such surviving relicts of the old
Court breeding as may linger yet amidst the
gloomy pomp of the Faubourg St. Germain. These
dues paid to etiquette, the countess briefly introduced
Helen, as Miss Digby, and seated herself
near the exile. In a few moments the two elder
personages became quite at home with each other;
and really, perhaps, Riccabocca had never, since
we have known him, showed to such advantage
as by the side of his polished, but somewhat formal
visitor. Both had lived so little with our modern,
ill-bred age! They took out their manners of a
former race, with a sort of pride in airing once
more such fine lace and superb brocade. Riccabocca
gave truce to the shrewd but homely wisdom
of his proverbs&mdash;perhaps he remembered that Lord
Chesterfield denounces proverbs as vulgar; and
gaunt though his figure, and far from elegant
though his dressing-robe, there was that about
him which spoke undeniably of the <i>grand seigneur</i>&mdash;of
one to whom a Marquis de Dangeau
would have offered <i>fauteuil</i> by the side of the
Rohans and Montmorencies.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Helen and Harley seated themselves
a little apart, and were both silent&mdash;the first, from
timidity; the second, from abstraction. At length
the door opened, and Harley suddenly sprang to
his feet&mdash;Violante and Jemima entered. Lady
Lansmere's eyes first rested on the daughter, and
she could scarcely refrain from an exclamation of
admiring surprise; but then, when she caught
sight of Mrs. Riccabocca's somewhat humble, yet
not obsequious mien&mdash;looking a little shy, a little
homely, yet still thoroughly a gentlewoman
(though of your plain rural kind of that genus)&mdash;she
turned from the daughter, and with the <i>savoir
vivre</i> of the fine old school, paid her first respects
to the wife; respects literally, for her manner implied
respect&mdash;but it was more kind, simple and
cordial than the respect she had shown to Riccabocca;
as the sage himself had said, here, "it
was Woman to Woman." And then she took
Violante's hand in both hers, and gazed on her
as if she could not resist the pleasure of contemplating
so much beauty. "My son," she
said, softly, and with a half sigh&mdash;"my son in
vain told me not to be surprised. This is the
first time I have ever known reality exceed description!"</p>

<p>Violante's blush here made her still more beautiful;
and as the countess returned to Riccabocca
she stole gently to Helen's side.
<a class="pagenum" id="page_679" title="pg 679"></a></p>

<p>"Miss Digby, my ward," said Harley, pointedly,
observing that his mother had neglected her
duty of presenting Helen to the ladies. He then
reseated himself, and conversed with Mrs. Riccabocca;
but his bright quick eye glanced ever at the
two girls. They were about the same age&mdash;and
youth was all that, to the superficial eye, they
seemed to have in common. A greater contrast
could not well be conceived; and, what is strange,
both gained by it. Violante's brilliant loveliness
seemed yet more dazzling, and Helen's fair, gentle
face yet more winning. Neither had mixed
much with girls of their own age; each took to
the other at first sight. Violante, as the less
shy, began the conversation.</p>

<p>"You are his ward&mdash;Lord L'Estrange's?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you came with him from Italy?"</p>

<p>"No, not exactly. But I have been in Italy
for some years."</p>

<p>"Ah! you regret&mdash;nay, I am foolish&mdash;you return
to your native land. But the skies in Italy
are so blue&mdash;here it seems as if nature wanted
colors."</p>

<p>"Lord L'Estrange says that you were very
young when you left Italy; you remember it
well. He, too, prefers Italy to England."</p>

<p>"He! Impossible!"</p>

<p>"Why impossible, fair skeptic?" cried Harley,
interrupting himself in the midst of a speech to
Jemima.</p>

<p>Violante had not dreamed that she could be
overheard&mdash;she was speaking low; but, though
visibly embarrassed, she answered distinctly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Because in England there is the noblest career
for noble minds."</p>

<p>Harley was startled, and replied, with a slight
sigh, "At your age I should have said as you do.
But this England of ours is so crowded with noble
minds, that they only jostle each other, and
the career is one cloud of dust."</p>

<p>"So, I have read, seems a battle to the common
soldier, but not to the chief."</p>

<p>"You have read good descriptions of battles, I
see."</p>

<p>Mrs. Riccabocca, who thought this remark a
taunt upon her daughter-in-law's studies, hastened
to Violante's relief.</p>

<p>"Her papa made her read the history of Italy,
and I believe that is full of battles."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harley.</span>&mdash;"All history is, and all women are
fond of war and of warriors. I wonder why."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Violante</span> (turning to Helen, and in a very
low voice, resolved that Harley should not hear
this time).&mdash;"We can guess why&mdash;can we not?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harley</span> (hearing every word, as if it had been
spoken in St. Paul's Whispering Gallery.)&mdash;"If
you can guess, Helen, pray tell me."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span> (shaking her pretty head, and answering
with a livelier smile than usual.)&mdash;"But I
am not fond of war and warriors."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harley</span> (to Violante).&mdash;"Then I must appeal
at once to you, self-convicted Bellona that you
are. Is it from the cruelty natural to the female
disposition?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Violante</span> (with a sweet musical laugh).&mdash;"From
two propensities still more natural to it."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harley.</span>&mdash;"You puzzle me: what can they
be?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Violante.</span>&mdash;"Pity and admiration; we pity
the weak, and admire the brave."</p>

<p>Harley inclined his head and was silent.</p>

<p>Lady Lansmere had suspended her conversation
with Riccabocca to listen to this dialogue.
"Charming!" she cried. "You have explained
what has often perplexed me. Ah, Harley, I am
glad to see that your satire is foiled; you have
no reply to that."</p>

<p>"No; I willingly own myself defeated&mdash;too
glad to claim the Signorina's pity, since my cavalry
sword hangs on the wall, and I can have no
longer a professional pretense to her admiration."</p>

<p>He then rose, and glanced toward the window.
"But I see a more formidable disputant for my
conqueror to encounter is coming into the field&mdash;one
whose profession it is to substitute some other
romance for that of camp and siege."</p>

<p>"Our friend Leonard," said Riccabocca, turning
his eye also toward the window. "True;
as Quevedo says wittily, 'Ever since there has
been so great a demand for type, there has been
much less lead to spare for cannon-balls.'"</p>

<p>Here Leonard entered. Harley had sent Lady
Lansmere's footman to him with a note, that
prepared him to meet Helen. As he came into
the room, Harley took him by the hand, and led
him to Lady Lansmere.</p>

<p>"The friend of whom I spoke. Welcome him
now for my sake, ever after for his own;" and
then, scarcely allowing time for the Countess's
elegant and gracious response, he drew Leonard
toward Helen. "Children," said he, with a
touching voice, that thrilled through the hearts
of both, "go and seat yourselves yonder, and talk
together of the past. Signorina, I invite you to
renewed discussion upon the abstruse metaphysical
subject you have started; let us see if we
can not find gentler sources for pity and admiration
than war and warriors." He took Violante
aside to the window. "You remember that
Leonard, in telling you his history last night,
spoke, you thought, rather too briefly of the little
girl who had been his companion in the rudest
time of his trials. When you would have questioned
more, I interrupted you, and said 'You
should see her shortly, and question her yourself.'
And now what think you of Helen Digby?
Hush, speak low. But her ears are not so sharp
as mine."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Violante.</span>&mdash;"Ah! that is the fair creature
whom Leonard called his child-angel? What a
lovely innocent face!&mdash;the angel is there still."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harley</span> (pleased both at the praise and with
her who gave it).&mdash;"You think so, and you are
right. Helen is not communicative. But fine
natures are like fine poems&mdash;a glance at the first
two lines suffices for a guess into the beauty that
waits you, if you read on."</p>

<p>Violante gazed on Leonard and Helen as they
sat apart. Leonard was the speaker, Helen the
<a class="pagenum" id="page_680" title="pg 680"></a>
listener; and though the former had, in his narrative
the night before, been indeed brief as to the
episode in his life connected with the orphan,
enough had been said to interest Violante in the
pathos of their former position toward each other,
and in the happiness they must feel in their meeting
again&mdash;separated for years on the wide sea
of life, now both saved from the storm and shipwreck.
The tears came into her eyes. "True,"
she said very softly, "there is more here to move
pity and admiration than in&mdash;" She paused.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harley.</span>&mdash;"Complete the sentence. Are you
ashamed to retract? Fie on your pride and
obstinacy."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Violante.</span>&mdash;"No; but even here there have
been war and heroism&mdash;the war of genius with
adversity, and heroism in the comforter who
shared it and consoled. Ah! wherever pity and
admiration are both felt, something nobler than
mere sorrow must have gone before: the heroic
must exist."</p>

<p>"Helen does not know what the word heroic
means," said Harley, rather sadly; "you must
teach her."</p>

<p>Is it possible, thought he as he spoke, that a
Randal Leslie could have charmed this grand
creature? No heroic, surely, in that sleek young
place-man. "Your father," he said aloud, and
fixing his eyes on her face, "sees much, he tells
me, of a young man, about Leonard's age, as to
date; but I never estimate the age of men by the
parish register; and I should speak of that so-called
young man as a contemporary of my great-grandfather;&mdash;I
mean Mr. Randal Leslie. Do
you like him?"</p>

<p>"Like him?" said Violante slowly, and as if
sounding her own mind. "Like him&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Harley, with dry and curt indignation.</p>

<p>"His visits seem to please my dear father.
Certainly, I like him."</p>

<p>"Hum. He professes to like you, I suppose?"</p>

<p>Violante laughed, unsuspiciously. She had
half a mind to reply, "Is that so strange?" But
her respect for Harley stopped her. The words
would have seemed to her pert.</p>

<p>"I am told he is clever," resumed Harley.</p>

<p>"O, certainly."</p>

<p>"And he is rather handsome. But I like
Leonard's face better."</p>

<p>"Better&mdash;that is not the word. Leonard's face
is as that of one who has gazed so often upon
heaven; and Mr. Leslie's&mdash;there is neither sunlight
nor starlight reflected there."</p>

<p>"My dear Violante!" exclaimed Harley, overjoyed;
and he pressed her hand.</p>

<p>The blood rushed over the girl's cheek and
brow; her hand trembled in his. But Harley's
familiar exclamation might have come from a
father's lips.</p>

<p>At this moment, Helen softly approached them,
and looking timidly into her guardian's face, said,
"Leonard's mother is with him: he asks me to
call and see her. May I?"</p>

<p>"May you! A pretty notion the Signorina
must form of your enslaved state of pupilage,
when she hears you ask that question. Of course
you may."</p>

<p>"Will you take me there?"</p>

<p>Harley looked embarrassed. He thought of
the widow's agitation at his name; of that desire
to shun him, which Leonard had confessed, and
of which he thought he divined the cause. And
so divining, he too shrank from such a meeting.</p>

<p>"Another time, then," said he, after a pause.</p>

<p>Helen looked disappointed, but said no more.</p>

<p>Violante was surprised at this ungracious answer.
She would have blamed it as unfeeling
in another. But all that Harley did, was right
in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Can not I go with Miss Digby?" said she,
"and my mother will go too. We both know
Mrs. Fairfleld. We shall be so pleased to see
her again."</p>

<p>"So be it," said Harley; "I will wait here
with your father till you come back. O, as to
my mother, she will excuse the&mdash;excuse Madame
Ricccabocca, and you too. See how charmed she
is with <i>your</i> father. I must stay to watch over
the conjugal interests of <i>mine</i>."</p>

<p>But Mrs. Riccabocca had too much good old
country breeding to leave the Countess; and
Harley was forced himself to appeal to Lady
Lansmere. When he had explained the case in
point, the Countess rose and said&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"But I will call myself, with Miss Digby."</p>

<p>"No," said Harley, gravely, but in a whisper.
"No&mdash;I would rather not. I will explain later."</p>

<p>"Then," said the Countess aloud, after a
glance of surprise at her son, "I must insist on
your performing this visit, my dear Madam, and
you, Signorina. In truth, I have something to
say confidentially to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To me," interrupted Riccabocca. "Ah,
Madame la Comtesse, you restore me to five-and-twenty.
Go, quick&mdash;O jealous and injured wife;
go, both of you, quick; and you, too, Harley."</p>

<p>"Nay," said Lady Lansmere, in the same
tone, "Harley must stay, for my design is not at
present upon destroying your matrimonial happiness,
whatever it may be later. It is a design
so innocent that my son will be a partner in it."</p>

<p>Here the Countess put her lips to Harley's ear,
and whispered. He received her communication
in attentive silence: but when she had done,
pressed her hand, and bowed his head, as if in
assent to a proposal.</p>

<p>In a few minutes, the three ladies and Leonard
were on their road to the neighboring cottage.</p>

<p>Violante, with her usual delicate intuition,
thought that Leonard and Helen must have
much to say to each other; and ignorant as Leonard
himself was, of Helen's engagement to Harley,
began already, in the romance natural to
her age, to predict for them happy and united
days in the future. So she took her step-mother's
arm, and left Helen and Leonard to follow.</p>

<p>"I wonder," she said musingly, "how Miss
Digby became Lord L'Estrange's ward. I hope
she is not very rich, nor very high-born."
<a class="pagenum" id="page_681" title="pg 681"></a></p>

<p>"La, my love," said the good Jemima, "that
is not like you; you are not envious of her, poor
girl?"</p>

<p>"Envious! Dear mamma, what a word!
But don't you think Leonard and Miss Digby
seem born for each other? And then the recollections
of their childhood&mdash;the thoughts of childhood
are so deep, and its memories so strangely
soft!" The long lashes drooped over Violante's
musing eyes as she spoke. "And therefore,"
she said; after a pause, "therefore, I hoped that
Miss Digby might not be very rich, nor very high-born."</p>

<p>"I understand you now, Violante," exclaimed
Jemima, her own early passion for match-making
instantly returning to her; "for as Leonard,
however clever and distinguished, is still the son
of Mark Fairfield the carpenter, it would spoil
all if Miss Digby was, as you say, rich and high-born.
I agree with you&mdash;a very pretty match,
a very pretty match, indeed. I wish dear Mrs.
Dale were here now&mdash;she is so clever in settling
such matters."</p>

<p>Meanwhile Leonard and Helen walked side by
side a few paces in the rear. He had not offered
her his arm. They had been silent hitherto
since they left Riccabocca's house.</p>

<p>Helen now spoke first. In similar cases it is
generally the woman, be she ever so timid, who
does speak first. And here Helen was the bolder;
for Leonard did not disguise from himself the
nature of his feelings, and Helen was engaged to
another; and her pure heart was fortified by the
trust reposed in it.</p>

<p>"And have you ever heard more of the good
Dr. Morgan, who had powders against sorrow,
and who meant to be so kind to us&mdash;though," she
added, coloring, "we did not think so then?"</p>

<p>"He took my child-angel from me," said Leonard,
with visible emotion; "and if she had not
returned, where and what should I be now?
But I have forgiven him. No, I have never met
him since."</p>

<p>"And that terrible Mr. Burley?"</p>

<p>"Poor, poor Burley! He, too, is vanished out
of my present life. I have made many inquiries
after him; all I can hear is that he went abroad,
supposed as a correspondent to some journal. I
should like so much to see him again, now that
perhaps I could help him as he helped me."</p>

<p>"<i>Helped</i> you&mdash;ah!"</p>

<p>Leonard smiled with a beating heart, as he
saw again the dear, prudent, warning look, and
involuntary drew closer to Helen. She seemed
more restored to him and to her former self.</p>

<p>"Helped me much by his instructions; more,
perhaps, by his very faults. You can not guess,
Helen&mdash;I beg pardon, Miss Digby&mdash;but I forgot
that we are no longer children; you can not
guess how much we men, and, more than all
perhaps, we writers, whose task it is to unravel
the web of human actions, owe even to our own
past errors; and if we learn nothing by the
errors of others, we should be dull indeed. We
must know where the roads divide, and have
marked where they lead to, before we can erect
our sign-posts; and books are the sign-posts in
human life."</p>

<p>"Books!&mdash;And I have not yet read yours.
And Lord L'Estrange tells me you are famous
now. Yet you remember me still&mdash;the poor
orphan child, whom you first saw weeping at her
father's grave, and with whom you burdened
your own young life, over-burdened already. No,
still call me Helen&mdash;you must always be to me&mdash;a
brother! Lord L'Estrange feels <i>that</i>; he
said so to me when he told me that we were to
meet again. He is so generous, so noble. Brother!"
cried Helen, suddenly, and extending her
hand, with a sweet but sublime look in her gentle
face&mdash;"brother, we will never forfeit his esteem;
we will both do our best to repay him!
Will we not&mdash;say so?"</p>

<p>Leonard felt overpowered by contending and
unanalyzed emotions. Touched almost to tears
by the affectionate address&mdash;thrilled by the hand
that pressed his own&mdash;and yet with a vague fear
a consciousness that something more than the
words themselves was implied&mdash;something that
checked all hope. And this word "brother,"
once so precious and so dear, why did he shrink
from it now?&mdash;why could he not too say the
sweet word "sister?"</p>

<p>"She is above me now and evermore?" he
thought, mournfully; and the tones of his voice,
when he spoke again, were changed. The appeal
to renewed intimacy but made him more
distant; and to that appeal itself he made no direct
answer; for Mrs. Riccabocca, now turning
round, and pointing to the cottage which came
in view, with its picturesque gable-ends, cried out,</p>

<p>"But is that your house, Leonard? I never
saw any thing so pretty."</p>

<p>"You do not remember it, then," said Leonard
to Helen, in accents of melancholy reproach&mdash;"there
where I saw you last! I doubted whether
to keep it exactly as it was, and I said, 'No!
the association is not changed because we try to
surround it with whatever beauty we can create;
the dearer the association, the more the Beautiful
becomes to it natural." "Perhaps you don't
understand this&mdash;perhaps it is only we poor poets
who do."</p>

<p>"I understand it," said Helen, gently. She
looked wistfully at the cottage.</p>

<p>"So changed&mdash;I have so often pictured it to
myself&mdash;never, never like this; yet I loved it,
commonplace as it was to my recollection; and
the garret, and the tree in the carpenter's yard."</p>

<p>She did not give these thoughts utterance
And they now entered the garden.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p>Mrs. Fairfield was a proud woman when she
received Mrs. Riccabocca and Violante in her grand
house; for a grand house to her was that cottage
to which her boy Lenny had brought her home.
Proud, indeed, ever was Widow Fairfield; but
she thought then in her secret heart, that if ever
she could receive in the drawing-room of that
<a class="pagenum" id="page_682" title="pg 682"></a>
grand house the great Mrs. Hazeldean, who had
so lectured her for refusing to live any longer in
the humble tenement rented of the Squire, the
cup of human bliss would be filled, and she could
contentedly die of the pride of it. She did not
much notice Helen&mdash;her attention was too absorbed
by the ladies who renewed their old acquaintance
with her, and she carried them all
over the house, yea, into the very kitchen; and
so, somehow or other, there was a short time
when Helen and Leonard found themselves alone.
It was in the study. Helen had unconsciously
seated herself in Leonard's own chair, and she
was gazing with anxious and wistful interest on
the scattered papers, looking so disorderly (though,
in truth, in that disorder there was method, but
method only known to the owner), and at the
venerable, well-worn books, in all languages, lying
on the floor, on the chairs&mdash;any where. I
must confess that Helen's first tidy womanlike
idea was a great desire to arrange the latter.
"Poor Leonard," she thought to herself&mdash;"the
rest of the house so neat, but no one to take care
of his own room and of him!"</p>

<p>As if he divined her thought, Leonard smiled,
and said, "It would be a cruel kindness to the
spider, if the gentlest hand in the world tried to
set its cobweb to rights."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen.</span>&mdash;"You were not quite so bad in the
old days."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leonard.</span>&mdash;"Yet even then, you were obliged
to take care of the money. I have more books
now, and more money. My present housekeeper
lets me take care of the books, but she is less indulgent
as to the money."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span> (archly).&mdash;"Are you as absent as
ever?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leonard.</span>&mdash;"Much more so, I fear. The habit
is incorrigible, Miss Digby&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen.</span>&mdash;"Not Miss Digby&mdash;sister, if you like."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leonard</span> (evading the word that implied so
forbidden an affinity).&mdash;"Helen, will you grant
me a favor? Your eyes and your smile say 'yes.'
Will you lay aside, for one minute, your shawl
and bonnet? What! can you be surprised that
I ask it? Can you not understand that I wish
for one minute to think you are at home again
under this roof?"</p>

<p>Helen cast down her eyes, and seemed troubled;
then she raised them, with a soft angelic
candor in their dovelike blue, and as if in shelter
from all thoughts of more warm affection, again
murmured "<i>brother</i>," and did as he asked her.</p>

<p>So there she sate, among the dull books, by his
table, near the open window&mdash;her fair hair parted
on her forehead&mdash;looking so good, so calm, so
happy! Leonard wondered at his own self-command.
His heart yearned to her with such inexpressible
love&mdash;his lips so longed to murmur,
"Ah, as now so could it be forever! Is the home
too mean?" But that word "brother" was as a
talisman between her and him.</p>

<p>Yet she looked so at home&mdash;perhaps so at home
she felt!&mdash;more certainly than she had yet learned
to do in that stiff stately house in which she
was soon to have a daughter's rights. Was she
suddenly made aware of this&mdash;that she so suddenly
arose&mdash;and with a look of alarm and distress
on her face&mdash;</p>

<p>"But&mdash;we are keeping Lady Lansmere too
long," she said, falteringly. "We must go now,"
and she hastily took up her shawl and bonnet.</p>

<p>Just then Mrs. Fairfield entered with the visitors,
and began making excuses for inattention
to Miss Digby, whose identity with Leonard's
child-angel she had not yet learned.</p>

<p>Helen received these apologies with her usual
sweetness. "Nay," she said, "your son and I
are such old friends, how could you stand on
ceremony with me?"</p>

<p>"Old friends!" Mrs. Fairfield stared amazed,
and then surveyed the fair speaker more curiously
than she had yet done. "Pretty, nice spoken
thing," thought the widow; "as nice spoken as
Miss Violante, and humbler-looking-like&mdash;though
as to dress, I never see any thing so elegant out
of a picter."</p>

<p>Helen now appropriated Mrs. Riccabocca's arm;
and after a kind leave-taking with the widow,
the ladies returned toward Riccabocca's house.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fairfield, however, ran after them with
Leonard's hat and gloves, which he had forgotten.</p>

<p>"'Deed, boy," said she, kindly, yet scoldingly,
"but there'd be no more fine books, if the Lord
had not fixed your head on your shoulders. You
would not think it, marm," she added to Mrs.
Riccabocca, "but sin' he has left you, he's not
the 'cute lad he was; very helpless at times,
marm!"</p>

<p>Helen could not resist turning round, and looking
at Leonard, with a sly smile.</p>

<p>The widow saw the smile, and catching Leonard
by the arm, whispered, "But, where before
have you seen that pretty young lady? Old
friends!"</p>

<p>"Ah, mother," said Leonard, sadly, "it is a
long tale; you have heard the beginning, who
can guess the end?"&mdash;and he escaped. But
Helen still leant on the arm of Mrs. Riccabocca,
and, in the walk back, it seemed to Leonard as
if the winter had resettled in the sky.</p>

<p>Yet he was by the side of Violante, and she
spoke to him with such praise of Helen! Alas!
it is not always so sweet as folks say, to hear the
praises of one we love. Sometimes those praises
seem to ask ironically, "And what right hast
thou to hope because thou lovest? <i>All</i> love <i>her</i>."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<p>
o sooner had Lady Lansmere found herself
alone with Riccabocca and Harley than she laid
her hand on the exile's arm, and, addressing him
by a title she had not before given him, and from
which he appeared to shrink nervously, said:
"Harley, in bringing me to visit you, was forced
to reveal to me your incognito, for I should have
discovered it. You may not remember me, in
spite of your gallantry. But I mixed more in
the world than I do now, during your first visit
to England, and once sate next to you at dinner
<a class="pagenum" id="page_683" title="pg 683"></a>
at Carlton House. Nay, no compliments, but
listen to me. Harley tells me you have cause for
some alarm respecting the designs of an audacious
and unprincipled&mdash;adventurer, I may call
him; for adventurers are of all ranks. Suffer
your daughter to come to me, on a visit, as long
as you please. With me, at least, she will be
safe; and if you, too, and the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop, my dear madam," interrupted Riccabocca,
with great vivacity; "your kindness over-powers
me. I thank you most gratefully for
your invitation to my child; but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nay," in his turn interrupted Harley, "no
buts. I was not aware of my mother's intention
when she entered this room. But since she whispered
it to me, I have reflected on it, and am convinced
that it is but a prudent precaution. Your
retreat is known to Mr. Leslie&mdash;he is known to
Peschiera. Grant that no indiscretion of Mr.
Leslie's betray the secret; still I have reason to
believe that the Count guesses Randal's acquaintance
with you. Audley Egerton this morning
told me he had gathered that, not from the young
man himself, but from questions put to himself
by Madame di Negra; and Peschiera might, and
would, set spies to track Leslie to every house
that he visits&mdash;might and would, still more naturally,
set spies to track myself. Were this man
an Englishman, I should laugh at his machinations;
but he is an Italian, and has been a conspirator.
What he could do, I know not; but an
assassin can penetrate into a camp, and a traitor
can creep through closed walls to one's hearth.
With my mother, Violante must be safe; that you
can not oppose. And why not come yourself?"</p>

<p>Riccabocca had no reply to these arguments,
so far as they affected Violante; indeed, they
awakened the almost superstitious terror with
which he regarded his enemy, and he consented
at once that Violante should accept the invitation
proffered. But he refused it for himself and
Jemima.</p>

<p>"To say truth," said he, simply, "I made a
secret vow, on re-entering England, that I would
associate with none who knew the rank I had
formerly held in my own land. I felt that all my
philosophy was needed, to reconcile and habituate
myself to my altered circumstances. In order to
find in my present existence, however humble,
those blessings which make all life noble&mdash;dignity
and peace&mdash;it was necessary for poor, weak human
nature, wholly to dismiss the past. It would unsettle
me sadly, could I come to your house, renew
awhile, in your kindness and respect&mdash;nay,
in the very atmosphere of your society&mdash;the sense
of what I have been; and then (should the more
than doubtful chance of recall from my exile fail
me) to awake, and find myself for the rest of life&mdash;what
I am. And though, were I alone, I might
trust myself perhaps to the danger&mdash;yet my wife:
she is happy and contented now; would she be
so, if you had once spoiled her for the simple
position of Dr. Riccabocca's wife? Should I not
have to listen to regrets, and hopes, and fears
that would prick sharp through my thin cloak of
philosophy? Even as it is, since in a moment
of weakness I confided my secret to her, I have
had 'my rank' thrown at me&mdash;with a careless
hand, it is true&mdash;but it hits hard, nevertheless.
No stone hurts like one taken from the ruins of
one's own home; and the grander the home,
why, the heavier the stone! Protect, dear madam&mdash;protect
my daughter, since her father doubts
his own power to do so. But&mdash;ask no more."</p>

<p>Riccabocca was immovable here. And the
matter was settled as he decided, it being agreed
that Violante should be still styled but the daughter
of Dr. Riccabocca.</p>

<p>"And now, one word more," said Harley.
"Do not confide to Mr. Leslie these arrangements;
do not let him know where Violante is
placed&mdash;at least, until I authorize such confidence
in him. It is sufficient excuse, that it is no use
to know unless he called to see her, and his movements,
as I said before, may be watched. You
can give the same reason to suspend his visits to
yourself. Suffer me, meanwhile, to mature my
judgment on this young man. In the mean
while, also, I think that I shall have means of
ascertaining the real nature of Peschiera's schemes.
His sister has sought to know me; I will give her
the occasion. I have heard some things of her in
my last residence abroad, which make me believe
that she can not be wholly the Count's tool in any
schemes nakedly villainous; that she has some
finer qualities in her than I once supposed; and
that she can be won from his influence. It is a
state of war: we will carry it into the enemy's
camp. You will promise me, then, to refrain
from all further confidence to Mr. Leslie."</p>

<p>"For the present, yes," said Riccabocca, reluctantly.</p>

<p>"Do not even say that you have seen me, unless
he first tell you that I am in England, and
wish to learn your residence. I will give him
full occasion to do so. Pish! don't hesitate; you
know your own proverb&mdash;</p>

<p class="i4">
'Boccha chiusa, ed occhio aperto<br />
Non fece mai nissun deserto.'<br />
</p>

<p>'The closed mouth and the open eye,' &amp;c."</p>

<p>"That's very true," said the Doctor, much
struck. "Very true. '<i>In boccha chiusa non
c'entrano mosche.</i>' One can't swallow flies if
one keeps one's mouth shut. <i>Corpo di Bacco!</i>
that's very true, indeed!"</p>

<p>Harley took aside the Italian.</p>

<p>"You see if our hope of discovering the lost
packet, or if our belief in the nature of its contents,
be too sanguine, still, in a few months it is
possible that Peschiera can have no further designs
on your daughter&mdash;possible that a son may
be born to you, and Violante would cease to be
in danger, because she would cease to be an heiress.
Indeed, it may be well to let Peschiera
know this chance; it would, at least, make him
delay all his plans while we are tracking the document
that may defeat them forever."</p>

<p>"No, no! for heaven's sake, no!" exclaimed
Riccabocca, pale as ashes. "Not a word to him.
I don't mean to impute to him crimes of which
<a class="pagenum" id="page_684" title="pg 684"></a>
he may be innocent. But he meant to take my
life when I escaped the pursuit of his hirelings in
Italy. He did not hesitate, in his avarice, to denounce
a kinsman; expose hundreds to the sword,
if resisting&mdash;to the dungeon, if passive. Did he
know that my wife might bear me a son, how
can I tell that his designs might not change into
others still darker, and more monstrous, than
those he now openly parades, though, after all,
not more infamous and vile. Would my wife's
life be safe? Not more difficult to convey poison
into my house, than to steal my child from my
hearth. Don't despise me; but when I think of
my wife, my daughter, and that man, my mind
forsakes me: I am one fear."</p>

<p>"Nay, this apprehension is too exaggerated.
We do not live in the age of the Borgias. Could
Peschiera resort to the risks of a murder; it is for
yourself that you should fear."</p>

<p>"For myself!&mdash;I! I!" cried the exile, raising
his tall stature to its full height. "Is it not
enough degradation to a man who has borne the
name of such ancestors, to fear for those he loves!
Fear for myself! Is it you who ask if I am a
coward?"</p>

<p>He recovered himself, as he felt Harley's penitential
and admiring grasp of the hand.</p>

<p>"See," said he, turning to the Countess, with
a melancholy smile, "how even one hour of your
society destroys the habits of years. Dr. Riccabocca
is talking of his ancestors!"</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<p>Violante and Jemima were both greatly surprised,
as the reader may suppose, when they
heard, on their return, the arrangements already
made for the former. The Countess insisted on
taking her at once, and Riccabocca briefly said,
"Certainly, the sooner the better." Violante
was stunned and bewildered. Jemima hastened
to make up a little bundle of things necessary,
with many a woman's sigh that the poor wardrobe
contained so few things befitting. But
among the clothes she slipped a purse, containing
the savings of months, perhaps of years, and
with it a few affectionate lines, begging Violante
to ask the Countess to buy her all that was proper
for her father's child. There is always something
hurried and uncomfortable in the abrupt
and unexpected withdrawal of any member from
a quiet household. The small party broke into
still smaller knots. Violante hung on her father,
and listened vaguely to his not very lucid explanations.
The Countess approached Leonard, and,
according to the usual mode with persons of quality
addressing young authors, complimented him
highly on the books she had not read, but which
her son assured her were so remarkable. She
was a little anxious to know how Harley had
met with Mr. Oran, whom he called his friend;
but she was too high-bred to inquire, or to express
any wonder that rank should be friends
with genius.</p>

<p>She took it for granted that they had formed
their acquaintance abroad.</p>

<p>Harley conversed with Helen.&mdash;"You are not
sorry that Violante is coming to us? She will
be just such a companion for you as I could desire;
of your own years too."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span> (ingenuously).&mdash;"It is hard to think I
am not younger than she is."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harley.</span>&mdash;"Why, my dear Helen?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen.</span>&mdash;"She is so brilliant. She talks so
beautifully. And I&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harley.</span>&mdash;"And you want but the habit of
talking, to do justice to your own beautiful
thoughts."</p>

<p>Helen looked at him gratefully, but shook her
head. It was a common trick of hers, and always
when she was praised.</p>

<p>At last the preparations were made&mdash;the farewell
was said. Violante was in the carriage by
Lady Lansmere's side. Slowly moved on the
stately equipage with its four horses and trim
postillions, heraldic badges on their shoulders, in
the style rarely seen in the neighborhood of the
metropolis, and now fast vanishing even amidst
distant counties.</p>

<p>Riccabocca, Jemima, and Jackeymo continued
to gaze after it from the gate.</p>

<p>"She is gone," said Jackeymo, brushing his
eyes with his coat sleeve. "But it is a load off
one's mind."</p>

<p>"And another load on one's heart," murmured
Riccabocca. "Don't cry, Jemima; it may be
bad for you, and bad for <i>him</i> that is to come. It
is astonishing how the humors of the mother may
affect the unborn. I should not like to have a son
who has a more than usual propensity to tears."</p>

<p>The poor philosopher tried to smile, but it was
a bad attempt. He went slowly in and shut himself
up with his books. But he could not read.
His whole mind was unsettled. And though, like
all parents, he had been anxious to rid himself of
a beloved daughter for life, now that she was
gone, but for a while, a string seemed broken in
the Music of Home.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<p>The evening of the same day, as Egerton, who
was to entertain a large party at dinner, was
changing his dress, Harley walked into his room.</p>

<p>Egerton dismissed his valet by a sign, and continued
his toilet.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, my dear Harley, I have only ten
minutes to give you. I expect one of the royal
dukes, and punctuality is the stern virtue of men
of business, and the graceful courtesy of princes."</p>

<p>Harley had usually a jest for his friend's aphorisms;
but he had none now. He laid his hand
kindly on Egerton's shoulder&mdash;"Before I speak of
my business, tell me how you are&mdash;better?"</p>

<p>"Better&mdash;nay, I am always well. Pooh! I
may look a little tired&mdash;years of toil will tell on
the countenance. But that matters little&mdash;the
period of life has passed with me when one cares
how one looks in the glass."</p>

<p>As he spoke, Egerton completed his dress, and
came to the hearth, standing there, erect and dignified
as usual, still far handsomer than many a
<a class="pagenum" id="page_685" title="pg 685"></a>
younger man, and with a form that seemed to
have ample vigor to support for many a year the
sad and glorious burthen of power.</p>

<p>"So now to your business, Harley."</p>

<p>"In the first place, I want you to present me,
at the first opportunity, to Madame di Negra.
You say she wished to know me."</p>

<p>"Are you serious?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, then, she receives this evening. I did
not mean to go; but when my party breaks up&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You can call for me at 'The Travelers.' Do!"</p>

<p>"Next&mdash;you knew Lady Jane Horton better
even than I did, at least in the last year of her
life." Harley sighed, and Egerton turned and
stirred the fire.</p>

<p>"Pray, did you ever see at her house, or hear
her speak of, a Mrs. Bertram?"</p>

<p>"Of whom?" said Egerton, in a hollow voice,
his face still turned toward the fire.</p>

<p>"A Mrs. Bertram; but Heavens! my dear fellow,
what is the matter? Are you ill?"</p>

<p>"A spasm at the heart&mdash;that is all&mdash;don't
ring&mdash;I shall be better presently&mdash;go on talking.
Mrs.&mdash;&mdash;; why do you ask?"</p>

<p>"Why? I have hardly time to explain; but
I am, as I told you, resolved on righting my old
Italian friend, if Heaven will help me, as it ever
does help the just when they bestir themselves;
and this Mrs. Bertram is mixed up in my friend's
affairs."</p>

<p>"His! How is that possible?"</p>

<p>Harley rapidly and succinctly explained. Audley
listened attentively, with his eyes fixed on the
floor, and still seeming to labor under great difficulty
of breathing.</p>

<p>At last he answered, "I remember something
of this Mrs.&mdash;Mrs.&mdash;Bertram. But your inquiries
after her would be useless. I think I have heard
that she is long since dead; nay, I am sure of it."</p>

<p>"Dead!&mdash;that is most unfortunate. But do
you know any of her relations or friends? Can
you suggest any mode of tracing this packet, if it
came to her hands?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"And Lady Jane had scarcely any friend that
I remember, except my mother, and she knows
nothing of this Mrs. Bertram. How unlucky!
I think I shall advertise. Yet, no. I could only
distinguish this Mrs. Bertram from any other of
the same name, by stating with whom she had
gone abroad, and that would catch the attention
of Peschiera, and set him to counterwork us."</p>

<p>"And what avails it?" said Egerton. "She
whom you seek is no more&mdash;no more!" He
paused, and went on rapidly&mdash;"The packet did
not arrive in England till years after her death&mdash;was
no doubt returned to the post-office&mdash;is destroyed
long ago."</p>

<p>Harley looked very much disappointed. Egerton
went on in a sort of set mechanical voice, as
if not thinking of what he said, but speaking from
the dry practical mode of reasoning which was
habitual to him, and by which the man of the
world destroys the hopes of an enthusiast. Then
starting up at the sound of the first thundering
knock at the street door, he said, "Hark! you
must excuse me."</p>

<p>"I leave you, my dear Audley. Are you better
now?"</p>

<p>"Much, much&mdash;quite well. I will call for you&mdash;probably
between eleven and twelve."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<p>If any one could be more surprised at seeing
Lord L'Estrange at the house of Madame di Negra
that evening than the fair hostess herself, it
was Randal Leslie. Something instinctively told
him that this visit threatened interference with
whatever might be his ultimate projects in regard
to Riccabocca and Violante. But Randal Leslie
was not one of those who shrink from an intellectual
combat. On the contrary, he was too confident
of his powers of intrigue, not to take a delight
in their exercise. He could not conceive
that the indolent Harley could be a match for his
own restless activity and dogged perseverance.
But in a very few moments fear crept on him.
No man of his day could produce a more brilliant
effect than Lord L'Estrange, when he deigned
to desire it. Without much pretense to that personal
beauty which strikes at first sight, he still
retained all the charm of countenance, and all
the grace of manner which had made him in boyhood
the spoiled darling of society. Madame di
Negra had collected but a small circle round her,
still it was of the <i>&eacute;lite</i> of the great world; not,
indeed, those more precise and reserved <i>dames du
ch&acirc;teau</i>, whom the lighter and easier of the fair
dispensers of fashion ridicule as prudes; but,
nevertheless, ladies were there, as umblemished
in reputation as high in rank; flirts and coquettes,
perhaps&mdash;nothing more; in short, "charming
women"&mdash;the gay butterflies that hover over the
stiff parterre. And there were embassadors and
ministers, and wits and brilliant debaters, and
first-rate dandies (dandies when first-rate, are
generally very agreeable men). Among all these
various persons, Harley, so long a stranger to the
London world, seemed to make himself at home
with the ease of an Alcibiades. Many of the
less juvenile ladies remembered him, and rushed
to claim his acquaintance, with nods, and becks,
and wreathed smiles. He had ready compliment
for each. And few indeed, were there, men or
women, for whom Harley L'Estrange had not
appropriate attraction. Distinguished reputation
as soldier and scholar, for the grave; whim and
pleasantry for the gay; novelty for the sated;
and for the more vulgar natures, was he not
Lord L'Estrange, unmarried, heir to an ancient
earldom, and some fifty thousand a year?</p>

<p>
ot till he had succeeded in the general effect&mdash;which,
it must be owned, he did his best to
create&mdash;did Harley seriously and especially devote
himself to his hostess. And then he seated
himself by her side; and as if in compliment to
both, less pressing admirers insensibly slipped
away and edged off.</p>

<p>Frank Hazledean was the last to quit his
<a class="pagenum" id="page_686" title="pg 686"></a>
ground behind Madame di Negra's chair; but
when he found that the two began to talk in
Italian, and he could not understand a word they
said, he too&mdash;fancying, poor fellow, that he looked
foolish, and cursing his Eton education that
had neglected, for languages spoken by the dead,
of which he had learned little, those still in use
among the living, of which he had learned naught&mdash;retreated
toward Randal, and asked wistfully,
"Pray, what age should you say L'Estrange was?
He must be devilish old, in spite of his looks.
Why, he was at Waterloo!"</p>

<p>"He is young enough to be a terrible rival,"
answered Randal, with artful truth.</p>

<p>Frank turned pale, and began to meditate
dreadful bloodthirsty thoughts, of which hair-triggers
and Lord's Cricket-ground formed the
staple.</p>

<p>Certainly there was apparent ground for a lover's
jealousy. For Harley and Beatrice now conversed
in a low tone, and Beatrice seemed agitated,
and Harley earnest. Randal himself grew
more and more perplexed. Was Lord L'Estrange
really enamored of the Marchesa? If so, farewell
to all hopes of Frank's marriage with her!
Or was he merely playing a part in Riccabocca's
interest; pretending to be the lover, in order to
obtain an influence over her mind, rule her through
her ambition, and secure an ally against her
brother? Was this <i>finesse</i> compatible with Randal's
notions of Harley's character? Was it consistent
with that chivalric and soldierly spirit of
honor which the frank nobleman affected, to
make love to a woman in mere <i>ruse de guerre</i>?
Could mere friendship for Riccabocca be a sufficient
inducement to a man, who, whatever his
weaknesses or his errors, seemed to wear on his
very forehead a soul above deceit, to stoop to
paltry means, even for a worthy end? At this
question, a new thought flashed upon Randal&mdash;might
not Lord L'Estrange have speculated himself
upon winning Violante?&mdash;would not that
account for all the exertions he had made on behalf
of her inheritance at the court of Vienna&mdash;exertions
of which Peschiera and Beatrice had
both complained? Those objections which the
Austrian government might take to Violante's
marriage with some obscure Englishman would
probably not exist against a man like Harley
L'Estrange, whose family not only belonged to
the highest aristocracy of England, but had always
supported opinions in vogue among the
leading governments of Europe. Harley himself,
it is true, had never taken part in politics, but
his notions were, no doubt, those of a high-born
soldier, who had fought, in alliance with Austria,
for the restoration of the Bourbons. And this
immense wealth&mdash;which Violante might lose if
she married one like Randal himself&mdash;her marriage
with the heir of the Lansmeres might actually
tend only to secure. Could Harley, with all his
own expectations, be indifferent to such a prize?&mdash;and
no doubt he had learned Violante's rare
beauty in his correspondence with Riccabocca.</p>

<p>Thus considered, it seemed natural to Randal's
estimate of human nature, that Harley's more
prudish scruples of honor, as regards what is due
to women, could not resist a temptation so strong.
Mere friendship was not a motive powerful enough
to shake them, but ambition was.</p>

<p>While Randal was thus cogitating, Frank thus
suffering, and many a whisper, in comment on
the evident flirtation between the beautiful hostess
and the accomplished guest, reached the ears
both of the brooding schemer and the jealous
lover, the conversation between the two objects
of remark and gossip had taken a new turn. Indeed,
Beatrice had made an effort to change it.</p>

<p>"It is long, my lord," said she, still speaking
Italian, "since I have heard sentiments like those
you address to me; and if I do not feel myself
wholly unworthy of them, it is from the pleasure
I have felt in reading sentiments equally foreign
to the language of the world in which I live."
She took a book from the table as she spoke:
"Have you seen this work?"</p>

<p>Harley glanced at the title-page. "To be
sure I have, and I know the author."</p>

<p>"I envy you that honor. I should so like also
to know one who has discovered to me deeps in
my own heart which I had never explored."</p>

<p>"Charming Marchesa, if the book has done
this, believe me that I have paid you no false
compliment&mdash;formed no overflattering estimate
of your nature; for the charm of the work is but
in its simple appeal to good and generous emotions,
and it can charm none in whom those
emotions exist not!"</p>

<p>"Nay, that can not be true, or why is it so
popular?"</p>

<p>"Because good and generous emotions are
more common to the human heart than we are
aware of till the appeal comes."</p>

<p>"Don't ask me to think that! I have found
the world so base."</p>

<p>"Pardon me a rude question; but what do you
know of the world?"</p>

<p>Beatrice looked first in surprise at Harley, then
glanced round the room with significant irony.</p>

<p>"As I thought; you call this little room 'the
world.' Be it so. I will venture to say, that if
the people in this room were suddenly converted
into an audience before a stage, and you were as
consummate in the actor's art as you are in all
others that please and command&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"And were to deliver a speech full of sordid
and base sentiments, you would be hissed. But
let any other woman, with half your powers,
arise and utter sentiments sweet and womanly,
or honest and lofty&mdash;and applause would flow
from every lip, and tears rush to many a worldly
eye. The true proof of the inherent nobleness of
our common nature is in the sympathy it betrays
with what is noble wherever crowds are collected.
Never believe the world is base;&mdash;if it were
so, no society could hold together for a day. But
you would know the author of this book? I will
bring him to you."</p>

<p>"Do."
<a class="pagenum" id="page_687" title="pg 687"></a></p>

<p>"And now," said Harley, rising, and with his
candid winning smile, "do you think we shall
ever be friends?"</p>

<p>"You have startled me so, that I can scarcely
answer. But why would you be friends with
me?"</p>

<p>"Because you need a friend. You have none."</p>

<p>"Strange flatterer!" said Beatrice, smiling,
though very sadly; and, looking up, her eye
caught Randal's.</p>

<p>"Pooh!" said Harley, "you are too penetrating
to believe that you inspire friendship <i>there</i>.
Ah, do you suppose that, all the while I have
been conversing with you, I have not noticed the
watchful gaze of Mr. Randal Leslie? What tie
can possibly connect you together I know not
yet; but I soon shall."</p>

<p>"Indeed! you talk like one of the old Council
of Venice. You try hard to make me fear you,"
said Beatrice, seeking to escape from the graver
kind of impression Harley had made on her, by
the affectation, partly of coquetry, partly of levity.</p>

<p>"And I," said L'Estrange, calmly, "tell you
already, that I fear you no more." He bowed,
and passed through the crowd to rejoin Audley,
who was seated in a corner, whispering with
some of his political colleagues. Before Harley
reached the minister, he found himself close to
Randal and young Hazeldean.</p>

<p>He bowed to the first, and extended his hand
to the last. Randal felt the distinction, and his
sullen, bitter pride was deeply galled&mdash;a feeling
of hate toward Harley passed into his mind. He
was pleased to see the cold hesitation with which
Frank just touched the hand offered to him. But
Randal had not been the only person whose watch
upon Beatrice the keen-eyed Harley had noticed.
Harley had seen the angry looks of Frank Hazeldean,
and divined the cause. So he smiled forgivingly
at the slight he had received.</p>

<p>"You are like me, Mr. Hazeldean," said he.
"You think something of the heart should go
with all courtesy that bespeaks friendship&mdash;</p>

<p>
"The hand of Douglas is his own."<br />
</p>

<p>Here Harley drew aside Randal. "Mr. Leslie,
a word with you. If I wished to know the retreat
of Dr. Riccabocca, in order to render him a
great service, would you confide to me that secret?"</p>

<p>"That woman has let out her suspicions that
I know the exile's retreat," thought Randal; and
with rare presence of mind, he replied at once:</p>

<p>"My Lord, yonder stands a connection of Dr.
Riccabocca's. Mr. Hazeldean is surely the person
to whom you should address this inquiry."</p>

<p>"Not so, Mr. Leslie; for I suspect that he can
not answer it, and that you can. Well, I will
ask something that it seems to me you may grant
without hesitation. Should you see Dr. Riccabocca,
tell him that I am in England, and so
leave it to him to communicate with me or not;
but perhaps you have already done so?"</p>

<p>"Lord L'Estrange," said Randal, bowing low,
with pointed formality, "excuse me if I decline
either to disclaim or acquiesce in the knowledge
you impute to me. If I am acquainted with any
secret intrusted to me by Dr. Riccabocca, it is for
me to use my own discretion how best to guard
it. And for the rest, after the Scotch earl, whose
words your lordship has quoted, refused to touch
the hand of Marmion, Douglas could scarcely have
called him back in order to give him&mdash;a message!"</p>

<p>Harley was not prepared for this tone in Mr
Egerton's <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i>, and his own gallant nature
was rather pleased than irritated by a haughtiness
that at least seemed to bespeak independence
of spirit. Nevertheless, L'Estrange's suspicions
of Randal were too strong to be easily set
aside, and therefore he replied, civilly, but with
covert taunt:</p>

<p>"I submit to your rebuke, Mr. Leslie, though
I meant not the offense you would ascribe to me.
I regret my unlucky quotation yet the more, since
the wit of your retort has obliged you to identify
yourself with Marmion, who, though a clever and
brave fellow, was an uncommonly&mdash;tricky one."
And so Harley, certainly having the best of it,
moved on, and joining Egerton, in a few minutes
more both left the room.</p>

<p>"What was L'Estrange saying to you?" asked
Frank. "Something about Beatrice, I am sure."</p>

<p>"No; only quoting poetry."</p>

<p>"Then what made you look so angry, my dear
fellow? I know it was your kind feeling for me.
As you say, he is a formidable rival. But that
can't be his own hair. Do you think he wears a
<i>toupet</i>? I am sure he was praising Beatrice. He
is evidently very much smitten with her. But I
don't think she is a woman to be caught by <i>mere</i>
rank and fortune! Do you? Why can't you
speak?"</p>

<p>"If you do not get her consent soon, I think
she is lost to you," said Randal, slowly; and, before
Frank could recover his dismay, glided from
the house.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX.</h3>

<p>Violante's first evening at the Lansmeres,
had seemed happier to her than the first evening,
under the same roof, had done to Helen. True
that she missed her father much&mdash;Jemima some
what; but she so identified her father's cause
with Harley, that she had a sort of vague feeling
that it was to promote that cause that she was
on this visit to Harley's parents. And the Countess,
it must be owned, was more emphatically
cordial to her than she had ever yet been to Captain
Digby's orphan. But perhaps the real difference
in the heart of either girl was this, that
Helen felt awe of Lady Lansmere, and Violante
felt only love for Lord L'Estrange's mother. Violante,
too, was one of those persons whom a reserved
and formal person, like the Countess, "can
get on with," as the phrase goes. Not so poor
little Helen&mdash;so shy herself, and so hard to coax
into more than gentle monosyllables. And Lady
Lansmere's favorite talk was always of Harley.
Helen had listened to such talk with respect and
interest. Violante listened to it with inquisitive
<a class="pagenum" id="page_688" title="pg 688"></a>
eagerness&mdash;with blushing delight. The mother's
heart noticed the distinction between the two, and
no wonder that that heart moved more to Violante
than to Helen. Lord Lansmere, too, like most
gentlemen of his age, clumped all young ladies
together, as a harmless, amiable, but singularly
stupid class of the genus Petticoat, meant to look
pretty, play the piano, and talk to each other
about frocks and sweethearts. Therefore this animated,
dazzling creature, with her infinite variety
of look and play of mind, took him by surprise,
charmed him into attention, and warmed
him into gallantry. Helen sat in her quiet corner,
at her work, sometimes listening with almost
mournful, though certainly unenvious admiration
at Violante's vivid, yet ever unconscious eloquence
of word and thought&mdash;sometimes plunged
deep into her own secret meditations. And all
the while the work went on the same, under the
same noiseless fingers. This was one of Helen's
habits that irritated the nerves of Lady Lansmere.
She despised young ladies who were fond
of work. She did not comprehend how often it
is the source of the sweet, womanly mind, not
from want of thought, but from the silence and
the depth of it. Violante was surprised, and perhaps
disappointed, that Harley had left the house
before dinner, and did not return all the evening.
But Lady Lansmere, in making excuse for his
absence, on the plea of engagements, found so
good an opportunity to talk of his ways in general&mdash;of
his rare promise in boyhood&mdash;of her regret
at the inaction of his maturity&mdash;of her hope
to see him yet do justice to his natural powers,
that Violante almost ceased to miss him.</p>

<p>And when Lady Lansmere conducted her to
her room, and, kissing her cheek tenderly, said,
"But you are just the person Harley admires&mdash;just
the person to rouse him from melancholy
dreams, of which his wild humors are now but
the vain disguise"&mdash;Violante crossed her arms
on her bosom, and her bright eyes, deepened into
tenderness, seemed to ask, "He melancholy&mdash;and
why?"</p>

<p>On leaving Violante's room, Lady Lansmere
paused before the door of Helen's; and, after
musing a little while, entered softly.</p>

<p>Helen had dismissed her maid; and, at the
moment Lady Lansmere entered, she was kneeling
at the foot of the bed, her hands clasped before
her face.</p>

<p>Her form, thus seen, looked so youthful and
child-like&mdash;the attitude itself was so holy and
so touching, that the proud and cold expression
on Lady Lansmere's face changed. She shaded
the light involuntarily, and seated herself in silence,
that she might not disturb the act of prayer.</p>

<p>When Helen rose, she was startled to see the
Countess seated by the fire; and hastily drew
her hand across her eyes. She had been weeping.</p>

<p>Lady Lansmere did not, however, turn to observe
those traces of tears, which Helen feared
were too visible. The Countess was too absorbed
in her own thoughts; and as Helen timidly approached,
she said&mdash;still with her eyes on the
clear low fire&mdash;"I beg your pardon, Miss Digby,
for my intrusion; but my son has left it to me
to prepare Lord Lansmere to learn the offer you
have done Harley the honor to accept. I have
not yet spoken to my lord; it may be days before
I find a fitting occasion to do so; meanwhile, I
feel assured that your sense of propriety will
make you agree with me that it is due to Lord
L'Estrange's father, that strangers should not
learn arrangements of such moment in his family,
before his own consent be obtained."</p>

<p>Here the Countess came to a full pause; and
poor Helen, finding herself called upon for some
reply to this chilling speech, stammered out, scarce
audibly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Certainly, madam, I never dreamed of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That is right, my dear," interrupted Lady
Lansmere, rising suddenly, and as if greatly relieved.
"I could not doubt your superiority to
ordinary girls of your age, with whom these matters
are never secret for a moment. Therefore,
of course, you will not mention, at present, what
has passed between you and Harley, to any of
the friends with whom you may correspond."</p>

<p>"I have no correspondents&mdash;no friends, Lady
Lansmere," said Helen deprecatingly, and trying
hard not to cry.</p>

<p>"I am very glad to hear it, my dear; young
ladies never should have. Friends, especially
friends who correspond, are the worst enemies
they can have. Good-night, Miss Digby, I need
not add, by the way, that, though we are bound
to show all kindness to this young Italian lady,
still she is wholly unconnected with our family;
and you will be as prudent with her as you would
have been with your correspondents&mdash;had you had
the misfortune to have any."</p>

<p>Lady Lansmere said the last words with a
smile, and pressed a reluctant kiss (the step-mother's
kiss) on Helen's bended brow. She then
left the room, and Helen sate on the seat vacated
by the stately, unloving form, and again covered
her face with her hands, and again wept. But
when she rose at last, and the light fell upon her
face, that soft face was sad indeed, but serene&mdash;serene,
as if with some inward sense of duty&mdash;sad,
as with the resignation which accepts patience
instead of hope.</p>

<p class="center">(TO BE CONTINUED.)</p>

<h2 id="PIPE-CLAY_AND_CLAY_PIPES">PIPE-CLAY AND CLAY PIPES.</h2>

<p class="drop">I have an eccentric friend, whom I meet occasionally.
He can not be said to have an
inquiring turn of mind, or usually to busy himself
with the science of industrial economy.
Babbage is an unknown writer to him; and he
has not yet contrived to "get up" any interest
in the recent Reports on Her Majesty's Customs.
In fact, I should not be surprised if he never
opened the interesting volumes in question. He
is a man with an active mind, nevertheless; but
this activity is expended, as a rule, in eccentric
pursuits. He has one confirmed antipathy&mdash;he
hates a purpose. Since he heard that I had
written a paper on the wrongs of factory children,
he has treated me with marked coolness
<a class="pagenum" id="page_689" title="pg 689"></a>
Yet he is a man with an excellent heart. Let
me at once give the key to his character. Most
people have one serious object in life, therefore
he is opposed to all serious objects. Lately, I
met him walking briskly on his way homeward,
and I consented to accompany him. Suddenly,
he remembered that he must make a call before
he entered his chambers.</p>

<p>This call led us out of a great thoroughfare,
through two or three narrow and dark streets, to
the door of a dingy house. As we paused on the
threshold, my companion asked me if I had ever
seen a tobacco-pipe manufactory. I expressed
my inexperience; and, having been cautioned
against sermons on what I was about to see, followed
my eccentric friend down a dark passage,
which terminated in a very dirty and a very dark
warehouse. A few samples of tobacco-pipes lay
upon a counter, and one side of the warehouse
was skirted with drawers full of "yards of clay"&mdash;my
eccentric friend's ordinary expression when
alluding to his pipes. In a dark corner, a strong
man was savagely punching huge blocks of clay
with a heavy wooden bar; in another corner lay
a huge pile of clay-blocks in the rough state&mdash;apparently
a heap of dirt, of little use to any
body. A mild woman&mdash;the wife of the manufacturer&mdash;showed
us about with a cheerful manner.
My friend, who took an evident interest in
all the processes we witnessed, still contrived to
maintain his eccentric habit, by continually expressing
his unconcern. As we looked at the
skillful action of the workmen's fingers, my friend
allowed that they played the fiddle well, but added
that they could <i>only</i> play the fiddle. However,
I left him to pursue his eccentric way, and
wandered about with unfeigned curiosity.</p>

<p>Turning from the muscular fellow who was
beating the rough clay with the wooden bar, and
moistening it, that it might yield to the pressure
of the mould, I suddenly saw a black gaping
mouth before me, that seemed to be in the agony
of swallowing a dense stack of tobacco-pipes;
this, I learned, was the pipe-kiln. The pipes
were arranged in exact rows, and in vast quantities.
I ventured to express my astonishment
at the number of pipes in the capacious kiln;
whereupon the clay-beater paused from his labor,
and, with a smile that expressed pity for my ignorance,
declared that there was a mere handful
on the premises.</p>

<p>"There are a few still, up there," he added,
pointing to the roof of the warehouse.</p>

<p>I followed the direction of his finger, and saw
above me a roof of tobacco-pipes piled in regular
rows on brackets. The number appeared incalculable,
but the clay-beater contemptuously pronounced
it insignificant. He informed me that
I might see "a few more," if I would have the
goodness to go up stairs. My eccentric friend
vowed that the trouble was excessive&mdash;that our
business was with the pipes when they had tobacco
in them; and not with the people who
made them; and, as he remarked (having had a
sharp pecuniary altercation with the manufacturer's
wife), who took particular care to charge
a remunerative price for them. But he mounted
the stairs, in spite of his objections, and followed
me into the room where the battered clay of the
beater below was undergoing other processes.
Here and there men seemed to be printing off
pipes&mdash;the action of their arms, and the movement
of their presses nearly resembling those of
hand-printing. A pale woman sat in the centre
of the room with a counter before her, and two
or three delicate tools; but we went past her at
once to the man who had a mound of soft gray
clay before him. He was working briskly. He
first seized two lumps of clay, each of the average
size of an apple, and having carelessly kneaded
them with his fingers, seemed to throw them
contemptuously upon the board before him.
Then, with the palms of his hand he rolled them
sharply out on the board, leaving one end of
each lump very thick, and producing, altogether,
two clay tadpoles of a large size. These he took
up, and placed with others in a row, all pressed
and sticking together. The apparent unconcern
and indifference with which the entire operation
was performed struck us particularly. When we
had sufficiently noticed the manufacture of gigantic
tadpoles, we crossed the room to an opposite
bench where a man was working rapidly.
Here we found a confused heap of clay tadpoles,
ready to be run through and burnt into seemly
pipes.</p>

<p>We watched the operations of the second
skilled laborer with intense interest. First, with
a weary air he took up a bundle of limp clay
tadpoles, and threw them down close beside him.
He then took a fine steel rod in his left hand,
and seizing a tadpole, drew its long slender tail
on to the rod. This operation was so dexterously
performed, that the rod never protruded the least
to the right or to the left, but was kept, by the
fine touch of the right-hand fingers, exactly in
the centre of the tube. The spitted tadpole was
then laid flat in the lower half of the metal pipe
mould; the upper part was pulled down over it,
and then pressed. On lifting the mould from
the press, the workman quickly cut away the
superfluous clay that stood up beyond the bowl,
opened the mould, and disclosed, to the undisguised
admiration even of my eccentric friend,
the graceful flow of his usual "yard of clay."
But it was not yet ready for smoking; very far
from it.</p>

<p>It was still a damp, leaden gray pipe, with
two broad seams of clay projecting from it,
throughout its entire length. It was ragged too.
On these deficiencies my friend began to offer a
few pungent remarks; when the workman interrupted
him by pointing toward an industrious
woman, who seemed to be in a desperate hurry;
yet she was not at all excited. My friend suggested
that steam must be circulating in her
nimble fingers, instead of blood. She smiled at
the pleasantry; and said meekly enough, that it
was custom. She was as clumsy as I should be
when she began&mdash;but long, long days of experience&mdash;there,
sitting before that board, and cutting
incessantly those seams that curl so neatly
<a class="pagenum" id="page_690" title="pg 690"></a>
off the rough pipes, give that dexterity, and it is
well, perhaps severely, paid for. The work-woman
wears a serious, dull face generally. It
struck me, as I watched the repetition of her
movements, that in their dreadful monotony
there must be a deadening influence upon the
mind and heart. I even thought that she must
find it a relief now and then to break a pipe, or
drop one of the glistening steel rods. First, she
took up one of the rough pipes, and with a sharp
steel instrument, smoothed all the rough clay
about the bowl. Then she smoothed the stem
with a flat instrument&mdash;then she cut the mouthpiece
even. Having thus rapidly traveled over
the moulder's work, she withdrew the fine steel
rod from the tube, blew down the pipe to assure
herself that the air passed from the bowl to the
mouth-piece, and then carefully added it to a
row, placed upon a frame beside her. The finished
pipe was hardly deposited in its place before
another was in her hands, and in rapid process
toward completion.</p>

<p>A roaring fire crackled in the grate, and the
heat of the atmosphere was oppressive. Above
were more endless rows and galleries of pipes;
waiting to be baked, and in a fair way, I thought,
of undergoing that process where they lay. I
could hear the dull, heavy sounds of the clay-beater's
weapon below, and in the rooms the incessant
click of the closing moulds. The workmen
were proud to show their dexterity, as they
well might be. Our friend in the farther corner,
as he talked pleasantly to us on various subjects,
still carelessly made his clay tadpoles; the woman
never paused from her rapid work when she
exchanged occasional sentences with a boy who
stood near her; and the wife of the manufacturer
surveyed the busy scene with sparkling eyes.</p>

<p>I thought once or twice of the damp clay
streaming about these workpeople; and of the
hard, stern work going on to provide receptacles
for lazy men's tobacco. Pipe-clay seemed to
force itself every where; about the rafters, on
the benches, on the floor, in the walls. My
friend's curiosity was soon satisfied: for his anxiety
to avoid contact with the raw material of his
favorite manufactured article, drove every other
consideration from his mind. He vowed that he
did not wish to appear in the streets of London
in the guise of a miller&mdash;that, generally, he preferred
a black coat to a piebald one, and that not
being a military man, the less pipe-clay he took
away in the nap of his clothes, the better. But
I had one or two questions to put to the tadpole-maker&mdash;not
with the view, as my friend stoutly
asserted, of writing a sermon, but perhaps with
an object sufficiently laudable. I learned that a
workman, "keeping to it" twelve hours, can
make "four gross and a half" of pipes per day.</p>

<p>My friend was struck with this astonishing
fact; and, forthwith, began to prove from this
assertion that he ought to have the half-gross he
wanted at a very low price indeed. It was only
when the workman paused, for the first time,
from his work to discuss the beauties of various
pipes, that my friend felt himself quite at home
in the manufactory. Hereupon, the workman
placed a variety of pipes in juxtaposition, and
began to talk of their relative excellences and
beauties with the tact of an artist. This man
was not without a shrewd sense of art; he had
his ideal of a tobacco-pipe, as the political dreamer
has his ideal of a model state, or a sculptor of
his ideal beauty. He had shrewd, unanswerable
reasons for a certain roundness in the bowl; his
eye wandered critically down the graceful bend
of the tube, and his hand tested nicely the finish
of the surface. His skill lay, certainly, only in
the manufacture of tobacco-pipes; but, still,
herein his mind was active, and his taste was
cultivated.</p>

<p>"What would become of you if smoking were
put down by Act of Parliament?" my friend
asked, with a sarcastic air. But the man was a
match even for the practiced eccentricity of my
companion.</p>

<p>"Why, sir," said the man, "most likely more
snuff would be consumed instead, and I should
shut up the kiln, and take to making snuffboxes."</p>

<p>My friend was silenced; and, as we walked
away from the manufactory, down the dark, narrow
streets, he allowed, in a whisper, that there
was wisdom in the pipemaker's answer. And
then he began to make calculations as to how
many people flourish in every country on the
bad habits and vices of their fellow-citizens. He
wove a chain of terrible length, to show how
many men were interested in the drunkenness
of the country. A man reeled past us in the
imbecile, singing stage of the vice. "That
man," said my eccentric friend, "has done the
state some service to-night. He has been helping
to swell the Excise returns; presently, he
will create a disturbance; a policeman will gallantly
walk him off to the station-house, and be
promoted; his hat will be broken, to the great
advantage of a hatter; his shirt front will be
torn, to the benefit of some poor, lone sempstress;
and there, he has broken his yard of clay, to the
advantage of the manufactory we have just left.
Delirium tremens will come at last; and with it
a surgeon; and, with the surgeon, herbs which
are now growing under the burning heat of Indian
skies." Thus my eccentric friend ran on,
and I did not interrupt him; for, in his words,
I detected sparks of light that led us merrily
forward to our journey's end, where we found
half-a-gross of "yards of clay;" "a perfect picture,"
according to my friend&mdash;lying, all white
as snow before us, trimmed, I knew, by the serious,
nimble-fingered woman we had seen at her
work. And she is at it now, still cutting the
seams off, and blowing down the tubes!</p>

<h2 id="HABITS_AND_CHARACTER_OF_THE">HABITS AND CHARACTER OF THE
DOG-RIB INDIANS.<sup><a href="#fn7" id="r7">[7]</a></sup></h2>

<p class="drop">Few traces of the stoicism popularly attributed
to the red races exist among the Dog
ribs; they shrink from pain, show little daring,
<a class="pagenum" id="page_691" title="pg 691"></a>
express their fears without disguise on all occasions,
imaginary or real, shed tears readily, and
live in constant dread of enemies, bodied and
disembodied. Yet all, young and old, enjoy a
joke heartily. They are not a morose people,
but, on the contrary, when young and in a situation
of security, they are remarkably lively and
cheerful. The infirmities of age, which press
heavily on the savage, render them querulous.
They are fond of dancing, but their dance, which
is performed in a circle, is without the least pretensions
to grace, and is carried on laboriously
with the knees and body half bent and a heavy
stamping, having the effect of causing the dancers
to appear as if they were desirous of sinking
into the ground. It is accompanied by a song
resembling a chorus of groans, or pretty nearly
the deep sigh of a pavier as he brings his rammer
down upon the pavement. They are great
mimics, and readily ape the peculiarities of any
white man; and many of the young men have
caught the tunes of the Canadian voyagers, and
hum them correctly.</p>

<p>The Dog-ribs are practical socialists; and, as
much of the misery they occasionally experience
may be traced to this cause, the study of the
working of such a system may be instructive in
a community like this, whose members owe
their condition in the social scale solely to their
personal qualities, and not to inheritance, favor,
or the other accidents which complicate the results
in civilized life. Custom has established
among them a practice universally acted upon&mdash;that
all may avail themselves of the produce of
a hunter's energy and skill; and they do not
even leave to him the distribution of his own
game. When it is known in the camp that deer
have been killed, the old men and women of each
family sally forth with their sledges, and, tracing
up the hunter's footsteps to the carcasses of the
animals he has slain, proceed to divide them
among themselves, leaving to the proper owner
the ribs, which is all that he can claim to himself
of right. He has also the tongue, which he
takes care to cut out on killing the deer. It is
not in the power of these people to restrain their
appetites when they have abundance; and the
consequence is, that when the chase is successful,
all the community feast and grow fat, however
little many of the men&mdash;and there are not a
few idle ones&mdash;may have contributed to the common
good. The hunter's wife dries the rib-pieces,
after cutting out the bone, in the smoke,
or over a fire, to carry to a fort for the purposes
of trade; but, unless there is a superabundance,
little provision is made by the party for a time
of scarcity, which is sure to arrive before long;
since the deer, when much hunted, move to some
other district. Taught by their frequent sufferings
on such occasions, the more active hunters
frequently withdraw themselves and their families
from the knowledge of the drones of the
community, leaving them at some fishing station,
where, with proper industry, they may subsist
comfortably. A fish diet is not, however, agreeable
to the palates of these people for any length
of time; and, as soon as rumors of a hunter's
success reach them&mdash;which they do generally
much exaggerated by the way&mdash;a longing for
the flesh-pots is instantly excited, especially
among the old, and a general movement to the
hunting-ground ensues. If, on their march, the
craving multitude discover a hoard of meat stored
up by any of the hunting parties, it is devoured
on the spot; but they are not always so fortunate.
Before they reach the scene of anticipated
abundance, the deer may have gone off, followed
by the hunters, with uncertain hopes of
overtaking them, and nothing remains for the
hungry throng, including the old and the lame,
but to retrace their steps, with the prospect of
many of them perishing by the way, should their
stock of food have been quite exhausted. Such
occurrences are by no means rare; they came
several times under our immediate notice during
our winter residence at Fort Confidence, and
similar facts are recorded by Mr. Simpson of the
same tribe. This gentleman expresses his opinion
that the charge made against this nation, of
abandoning their infirm aged people and children,
had its origin in the <i>sauve qui peut</i> cry raised
during a forced retreat from some one of these
most injudicious excursions; and I am inclined
fully to agree with him; for I witnessed several
unquestionable instances of tenderness and affection
shown by children to their parents, and of
compliance with their whims, much to their own
personal inconvenience. The grief they show
on the loss of a parent, is often great and of long
continuance, and it is the custom, both for men
and women, to lament the death of relations for
years, by nightly wailings.</p>

<p>Hospitality is not a virtue which is conspicuous
among the Dog-ribs, who differ in this respect
from the Eythinyuwuk, in whose encampments
a stranger meets a welcome and a proffer
of food. It is not customary, however, for the
Dog-rib to receive the traveler who enters his
tent with the same show of kindness. If he is
hungry, and meat hangs up, he may help himself
without eliciting a remark, for the 'Tinn&egrave;
hold it to be mean to say much about a piece
of meat; or he may exert his patience until
some cookery goes on, and then join in the
meal; and should there be venison at hand,
he will not have long to wait, for every now
and then some one is prompted to hang a kettle
on the fire, or to place a joint or steak to roast
before it.</p>

<p>Of the peculiarities of their religious belief I
could gain no certain information. The interpreters
to whom I applied for assistance disliked
the task, and invariably replied, "As for these
savages, they know nothing; they are ignorant
people." The majority of the nation recognize
a "Great Spirit," at least by name, but some
doubt his existence, assigning, as a reason for
their atheism, their miserable condition; or they
say, "If there be such a being, he dwells on the
lands of the white people, where so many useful
and valuable articles are produced." With respect
to evil spirits, their name in the Dog-rib
<a class="pagenum" id="page_692" title="pg 692"></a>
country is legion. The 'Tinn&egrave; recognize them
in the Bear, Wolf, and Wolverene, in the woods,
waters, and desert places; often hear them howling
in the winds, or moaning by the graves of
the dead. Their dread of these disembodied
beings, of whom they spoke to us under the
general name of "enemies," is such that few of
the hunters will sleep out alone. They never
make any offerings to the Great Spirit, or pay
him an act of adoration; but they deprecate the
wrath of an evil being by prayer, and the sacrifice
of some article, generally of little value, perhaps
simply by scattering a handful of deer hair
or a few feathers.</p>

<h2 id="MONTHLY_RECORD_OF_CURRENT_EVENTS">MONTHLY RECORD OF CURRENT EVENTS.</h2>

<h3>THE UNITED STATES.</h3>

<p>In Congress, during the past month, there has
been copious discussion of a great variety of subjects,
but no important action upon any. The influence
of the approaching Presidential election
makes itself felt upon the debates of Congress, coloring
every speech and often superseding every other
subject. Memorials have been presented in favor
of authorizing another Arctic expedition in search of
Sir John Franklin, for which Mr. Henry Grinnell
again tenders the use of his ships&mdash;asking only that
the government will send a small steamer with them
and men for officers and sailors. Commander Wilkes
has also addressed Congress on the subject; proposing
a very large Expedition&mdash;sufficient indeed to
establish a permanent settlement in the Arctic regions,
from which the search may be prosecuted. Nothing
has been done with regard to either.&mdash;&mdash;Governor
Kossuth has addressed to Congress a letter of thanks
for the reception given him, which was presented in
the Senate on the 17th of February, and gave rise to
a long debate on the proposition to print it: it was
ordered to be printed by 21 votes to 20 against it.&mdash;&mdash;In
the Senate a bill has been reported by Commitee
to establish a branch mint in the city of New
York, on condition that the city donate land for a site
and the State exempt it from taxation.&mdash;&mdash;A good
deal of the attention of the Senate has been devoted
to a debate upon the Public Land policy of the country,
the question coming up on a bill granting large
tracts of land to Iowa to aid in the construction of
certain railroads. Mr. Sumner, of Massachusetts,
spoke in favor of ceding all the public lands to the
States in which they lie, mainly on the ground that
the exemption of those lands from State taxation had
created in those States an equitable title to them.
On the 24th of February Mr. Geyer, of Missouri,
spoke in favor of the same policy, basing his argument
in its support upon the same facts. Mr. Underwood
offered an amendment to the effect of distributing
among the seventeen States in which there
are no public lands, fifteen millions of acres. He
spoke in defense of it at length. No vote has been
taken upon the subject.&mdash;&mdash;Further debate has been
had upon the resolutions on the subject of non-intervention.
On the 26th of February, Mr. Miller, of New
Jersey, spoke against the policy of intermeddling at
all in the affairs of foreign nations. He represented
intervention in foreigns affairs as the habitual policy
of European monarchies, which Washington had resisted;
and he urged the duty and necessity of adhering
strictly to the ground of neutrality which was
adopted during the early history of this country.
The subject was then postponed until the 9th of
March, when Mr. Seward of New York, spoke upon
it. He urged the absolute independence of every
State, and the duty of all States to recognize and
respect it. He entered upon a historical review of
the connection of Hungary and Austria to show that
Hungary was fully entitled to this right, and that it
had been grossly violated when her freedom and
constitution were destroyed by the armed intervention
of Russia. He then urged that the United
States, although recognizing the existing rule in
Hungary from motives of political necessity, can not
be indifferent to such usurpation, and may lawfully
protest against it, and especially against any new
intervention should it be intended by Russia. He
referred to the diplomatic history of the United
States to show that this principle has always been
recognized and practiced by them, and insisted that
there was no reason why it should now be abandoned.
Upon the conclusion of his speech the subject was
postponed for a week.&mdash;&mdash;A debate of personal rather
than general interest occurred in the Senate on the
27th and 28th of February, between Mr. Rhett of
South Carolina and Mr. Clemens of Alabama. The
former read a very long paper which he had prepared
to expose the political inconsistencies of Mr.
Clemens, and in which he used strong language in
characterizing his course. Mr. Clemens replied with
passionate warmth and with increased vituperation
Their speeches have no general interest or importance.&mdash;&mdash;In
the <i>House of Representatives</i> discussion,
although it has comprehended various subjects, has
grown mainly out of bills to appropriate public lands
to certain railroads in Missouri and Illinois. They
have been debated with a good deal of warmth, and
almost every speaker has connected with them the
discussion of the Presidential question. In the
course of the debate a letter from Gen. William O.
Butler, addressed to a personal friend, was read, in
which he declares his entire assent and approval of
the Compromise Measures of 1850. On the 1st of
March, Mr. Fitch of Iowa offered a resolution deprecating
all further agitation of the questions growing
out of these measures as useless and dangerous: and
a vote was taken on a motion to suspend the rules
so as to allow its introduction: there were ayes 119,
nays 74. As two-thirds were required to pass it, the
motion failed.&mdash;&mdash;On the 20th of February a message
was received from the President, transmitting, in reply
to a resolution of the House, copies of the correspondence
between the officers of the Mississippi
and the Government concerning Kossuth. It was
quite voluminous, embracing letters from other American
functionaries as well as naval officers. They
show on the part of all of them a strong distrust of
Kossuth's plans and great dissatisfaction at the marks
of respect paid to him at the various ports on the
Mediterranean, at which the Mississippi touched.
His returning thanks to the people at Marseilles who
cheered him, is especially censured.</p>

<p>The month has been marked by several literary
discourses of more than common interest. At the
anniversary meeting of the New York Historical
<a class="pagenum" id="page_693" title="pg 693"></a>
Society, held on the 23d of February, Hon. Daniel
Webster read an elaborate paper upon the dignity
and importance of History, and making sundry detailed
criticisms upon the historical writings of ancient
and modern historians. He dwelt somewhat
minutely upon all the great writers of Greece and
Rome, and passed more hastily over those of England.
He sketched the early history of the United States,
dwelling especially upon the proceedings of the first
Congress after the Constitution, and pronouncing a
high eulogy upon the great men to whose hands the
legislation of that important era was intrusted. He
closed by alluding to the dangers which had recently
menaced the Union and the Constitution, and declared
himself ready to co-operate with those of
every party who would rally in their defense. The
discourse was heard with marked attention by an
immense and intelligent audience.&mdash;&mdash;On the evening
of the 27th, a very large meeting was held in
New York to testify regard for the memory of the
late J. Fenimore Cooper. The occasion was distinguished
by the attendance, as presiding officer, of
Mr. Webster, and by the presence of a great number
of distinguished literary gentlemen. Mr. Webster
made a brief address, expressing his cordial interest
in the occasion, and the high respect which he entertained
for the writings of Cooper, as being preeminent
for their thorough American feeling and
high moral tone, as well as great intellectual ability.
William Cullen Bryant delivered a commemorative
address, rehearsing Mr. Cooper's life, and making
passing criticisms upon his successive works.&mdash;&mdash;On
the evening of March 8th, Archbishop Hughes
read a Lecture on the Catholic Chapter in the History
of the United States, the leading purpose of
which was to show that in this country no religious
denomination has any claim to supremacy&mdash;that it
is neither Protestant nor Catholic&mdash;but that the Constitution
prohibits all legislation upon the subject,
and that all stand upon precisely the same level.&mdash;&mdash;A Whig
State Convention was held in Kentucky, at
Frankfort, on the 24th of February. Hon. Chilton
Allan presided. A series of resolutions was adopted,
pronouncing in favor of the Compromise measures
of 1850, and of the course pursued by the President
of the United States in securing the execution
of the laws. They also declared in favor of public
appropriations for internal improvements, against
granting the public lands to the States in which they
lie, and in favor of maintaining strict neutrality in
the affairs of all foreign nations. The Convention
declared its willingness to abide by the nomination
of a Whig National Convention, but presented President
Fillmore to the consideration of that body, as
a "statesman of such approved prudence, experience,
firmness, and wisdom as to unite the entire Whig
vote of Kentucky."&mdash;&mdash;A large public meeting was
held in New York, on the 5th of March, of those in
favor of the nomination of Mr. Webster for the
Presidency, subject to the decision of a National
Whig Convention. Mr. George Griswold presided.
An address was adopted rehearsing the public history
of Mr. Webster, and referring to his services to
the country in the various public offices which he
has held.&mdash;&mdash;A Whig State Convention in Indiana
adopted resolutions nominating General Scott for
the Presidency.&mdash;&mdash;Washington's birth-day was celebrated
at the National Capital by a banquet, got up
mainly by members of Congress. Senator Stockton
presided, and speeches were made by several gentlemen&mdash;mainly
directed against the policy of intermeddling
to any degree or for any purpose in the
affairs of foreign nations. Mr Clay, whose illness
prevented his attendance, wrote a letter, saying that
the serious efforts made to subvert the policy of
neutrality established by Washington, called for energetic
measures of resistance. The attempts made
to induce this country to plunge, by perilous proceedings
and insensible degrees, in the wars of Europe,
rendered it proper to recall attention to his principles
by celebrating his birth-day.</p>

<p>From <span class="smcap">California</span> we have intelligence to the 2d
of February. Col. <span class="smcap">John B. Weller</span> (Democrat)
has been elected United States Senator in place of
Col. Fr&eacute;mont. He was once candidate for Governor
of Ohio and more recently chief of the Mexican
Boundary Commission.&mdash;&mdash;Governor Bigler has sent
to the Legislature a special message, concerning
the financial affairs of the State, in which he urges
upon the Legislature the early adoption of measures
to relieve the burden of the State's liabilities, and
exhibits the amount of her indebtedness. According
to the Controller's report, $1,000,000 still stands
against the State from the expenses of last year's
military expeditions. The aggregate indebtedness,
civil and military, of the State, on the 31st December
was $2,242,339 74.&mdash;&mdash;There had been no further
disturbances from the Indians, though further precautions
against them had been taken by sending
troops into their neighborhood.&mdash;&mdash;Hon. T. B. King
has published a letter recommending the relinquishment
of the public lands to actual settlers, and the
confirmation by Congress of the rules established by
the miners themselves, defining the rights of those
who may be employed in the collection of gold, or
who may invest capital in machinery for the purpose
of working the vein mines.&mdash;&mdash;Intelligence from the
mining districts continues to be encouraging. The
quartz mining companies are generally doing well,
though from defects in machinery some failures have
occurred. New discoveries continue to be made.</p>

<p>From <span class="smcap">Oregon</span> our advices are to Jan. 24. The
Legislature and Judiciary disagree about the seat of
government, part of the members meeting in the
place fixed by judicial decision, and others refusing
to concur in the decision and meeting elsewhere.
The dispute has been transferred to the people, by
the adjournment of the Assembly on the 21st of Jan.
It is canvassed with great warmth and earnestness.&mdash;&mdash;Some
doubts having arisen as to the true boundary
line between Oregon and California, the Surveyor-general
has been directed to make the necessary
observations to determine it.</p>

<p>In the Territory of <span class="smcap">
ew Mexico</span>, from which we
have news to Jan. 31st, fresh Indian outrages have
occurred. An escort of United States troops, consisting
of a sergeant and four men, was proceeding
southward when they were attacked by a band of
Apaches in ambush, and four of the party were
killed; the other succeeded in making his escape.
Four murders were perpetrated also near Polvodera
in the early part of January, and soon after the Indians
attacked a party of nine persons of whom they
killed five. The scene of these outrages is the desert
region called the Jornada, lying on the route
from Santa F&eacute; to Chihuahua. The daring nature
of the attacks of the several tribes of Indians had
created great alarm throughout the country. A body
of troops had been sent out to punish the Indians for
these murders, but returned without success.&mdash;&mdash;Movements
are in progress in Santa F&eacute; to work the
gold placers known to exist in that vicinity. The
chief difficulty has hitherto arisen from the want of
water for washing the dust: this is now to be remedied
by digging wells. A gold hunting company of
forty men has left Santa F&eacute; for a thorough exploration
<a class="pagenum" id="page_694" title="pg 694"></a>
of the Gila region: they expected to find others
on the way to join them, so as to swell their number
to a hundred and fifty which would be sufficient for
self-defense.</p>

<p>From <span class="smcap">Utah</span> the last California mail brought news
that the Mormons at the Great Salt Lake city had
published a declaration of independence, announcing
their determination to setup a republic for themselves&mdash;that
they had put the United States' authorities at
defiance&mdash;that all the United States' officers had
left, and the people were preparing to resist all authority,
by fortifying their settlements. The delegate in
Congress from Utah, Mr. John W. Bernhisel, published
a card on the 1st of March, pronouncing the
report untrue, so far as the latest intelligence from
home which had reached him enabled him to give an
opinion. He said he thought the rumor was merely
an exaggerated statement of difficulties previously
known. On the other hand, another gentleman who
left California on the 16th of December, expresses
the belief that the accounts are true. He says that
the news was by no means unexpected to the people
of Oregon and California, as they had long been
aware of their hostile and ambitious designs. For
decisive intelligence we shall be obliged to wait for
another arrival.</p>

<p>From <span class="smcap">
orthern Mexico</span> we have news of a renewed
repulse of Carvajal, whom our last Record left
on the Rio Grande, recruiting his forces. General
Avalos fortified Matamoras against an expected attack,
which had created great alarm among the inhabitants.
On the 20th of February Carvajal attacked
Camargo with a force of over 500 men, but he was
repulsed with decided loss. He succeeded in escaping
to the American side of the Rio Grande. Of his
whole force it is stated that only 84 were Mexicans.</p>

<p>From <span class="smcap">South America</span> we have intelligence of a
later date. In <i>Venezuela</i>, from which we have news
to the 1st of February, Congress opened on the 25th
of January. The Message of President Monagas
announces a great improvement in the financial condition
of the country. All the obligations on account
of the public service have been met&mdash;the expenses
of the wars of 1848 and 1849 have been partially
liquidated&mdash;the interest on the domestic debt, which
has not been satisfied since 1847, has been paid, and
the installments on the foreign debt, which have been
neglected for some years, have been promptly remitted to
London&mdash;thus improving the national credit
abroad.&mdash;&mdash;From the <i>La Plata</i> we have intelligence
of an engagement, about the 1st of January, between
the forces of Rosas and Urquiza, which is said to
have resulted in the victory of the former, and in the
desertion to his standard of five thousand of Urquiza's
troops. It is not easy to say how much of this
is reliable.&mdash;&mdash;Political offenders in <i>Chili</i> have been
for some years banished to the Straits of Magellan.
An insurrection took place among them lately, in
which they killed the governor, seized the garrison,
and declared themselves independent of Chili. It is
said that they have also seized two or three American
vessels.</p>

<h3>GREAT BRITAIN.</h3>

<p>The political events of the month in England have
been of striking interest and importance. The expulsion
of Lord Palmerston from the Cabinet, mainly
for offenses against etiquette&mdash;the meeting of Parliament,
and the subsequent defeat and retirement of
the Russell Ministry, with the reinstatement of a
Protectionist Cabinet, are certainly events of more
consequence than are usually crowded into a single
month.</p>

<p>Parliament met on the 3d of February, and was
opened in person by the Queen. Her speech announced
that she continued to maintain the most
friendly relations with Foreign Powers. She had
reason to believe that the treaty between Germany
and Denmark, concluded at Berlin year before last,
will soon be fully executed. Although tranquillity
has prevailed throughout the greater part of Ireland,
certain parts of the counties of Armagh, Monaghan,
and Louth have been marked by the commission of
outrages of the most serious description. Bills have
been prepared founded upon the reports of the Commissioners
appointed to inquire into the practice and
proceedings of the Superior Courts of Law and
Equity, which are commended to deliberate attention.
The act of 1848 suspending the previous act
which conferred representative institutions on New
Zealand, expires early next year; and no reason exists
for its renewal. The large reductions of taxes
which have taken place of late years have not been
attended with a proportionate diminution of national
income. The revenue of the past year has been
fully adequate to the demands of the public service,
while the reduction of taxation has tended greatly to
the relief and comfort of the people. The Queen
states that it appears to her that "this is a fitting
time for calmly considering whether it may not be
advisable to make such amendments in the act of
the late reign, relating to the Representation of the
Commons in Parliament, as may be deemed calculated
to carry into more complete effect the principles
upon which that law is founded." She had
"the fullest confidence that, in any such consideration,
Parliament would firmly adhere to the acknowledged
principles of the Constitution, by which the
prerogatives of the Crown, the authority of both
Houses of Parliament, and the rights and liberties
of the people are equally secured."</p>

<p>Previous to the meeting of Parliament, the public
was taken completely by surprise by the retirement
of Lord Palmerston from the Ministry, and the appointment
of Earl Granville as his successor. In
the House of Commons explanations took place on
the first day of the session. The reply to the Queen's
speech was moved by Sir Richard Bulkeley; but,
before the question was taken, Sir Benjamin Hall
called upon the Premier for explanations of the disruption
of the Ministry. Lord John Russell immediately
entered upon the subject, and after declaring
his former confidence in Lord Palmerston's management
of Foreign Affairs, and stating that in 1835,
and again in 1845 and 1846 he had strongly recommended
him for that department, went on to state
his conception of the position of the Foreign Secretary
toward the Crown and the Prime Minister. He
believed it to be the duty of the Minister to give to
the Crown the most full and frank details of every
measure, and either to obey the instructions he may
receive, or resign. It "did so happen," he said,
"that in 1850 precise terms were laid down in a
communication from the Queen to Lord Palmerston&mdash;in
which Her Majesty required, first, that Lord
Palmerston should distinctly state what he proposes
in a given case, in order that the Queen may know
as distinctly to what she is giving her Royal sanction;
and, secondly, that having once given her
sanction to a measure, that it be not arbitrarily altered
or modified by the Minister. The Queen further
expected to be kept informed of what passes between
the Foreign Secretary and the Foreign Ministers,
before important decisions are taken based upon that
intercourse&mdash;to receive the foreign dispatches in good
time, and to have the drafts for her approval sent to
her in sufficient time to make herself acquainted
<a class="pagenum" id="page_695" title="pg 695"></a>
with their contents before they must be sent off."&mdash;In
reply to this communication, Lord Palmerston
said he would not fail to attend to the directions
which it contained.&mdash;As for the Prime Minister, Lord
John Russell said he considered him, in fact, responsible
for the business of the department. At a meeting
of the Cabinet, on the 3d of November, Lord
John expressed his opinion on the situation of Europe,
which he deemed very critical. There was a
prospect of seeing social democracy, or absolute
power triumphant on the Continent; and in either
case the position of England would be very critical.
He thought it necessary, therefore, for England to
preserve a strict neutrality, and to exercise the utmost
vigilance to prevent any cause of offense being
given. Yet very soon after that, Lord Palmerston
received a deputation, and listened to addresses
containing expressions in the highest degree offensive
to sovereigns in alliance with England. Still Lord
John said he was willing to take the responsibility
for all this, as he thought the Secretary had merely
committed an error.&mdash;The next cause of difference
occurred immediately after the usurpation of Louis
Napoleon on the 2d of December. The next day a
cabinet meeting was held, at which a request was
presented from Lord Normanby, the English Minister
at Paris, that he might be furnished with instructions
as to the continuance of diplomatic relations
with the new Government. In conformity with the
decision then made, Lord Palmerston, on the 5th,
instructed him to make no change in his relations
with the French government. On the 6th, Lord
Normanby wrote saying that he had called on M.
Turgot, the French Minister, and informed him of
this decision, to which M. Turgot replied that it
was of less consequence as he had two days since
heard from M. Walewski, the French Minister in
London, that Lord Palmerston had expressed to him
his entire approbation of the act of the President,
and his conviction that he could not have acted
otherwise than he had done. On seeing this dispatch,
Lord John asked Lord Palmerston for an
explanation, but got no answer. On the 13th of
December, he received a letter from the Queen, requesting
an explanation; but Lord Palmerston maintained
the same disdainful silence. On the 17th,
he received another dispatch from Lord Normanby
to Lord Palmerston, complaining that Lord Palmerston
should use one language in his instructions
to him and another to the French Minister in London,
and that while enjoining him not to express
any opinion of French politics, he should himself
have expressed a very decided judgment. Such a
course, he added, subjected him to misrepresentation
and suspicion. Lord Palmerston, in reply to this,
stated that Lord Normanby's instructions related
only to his conduct, and not to opinions: but that
if he wished to know Lord Palmerston's opinion
concerning French affairs, it was, that "such a
state of antagonism had arisen between the President
and the Assembly, that it was becoming every
day more clear that their coexistence could not be
of long duration; and it seemed to him better for the
interests of France, and through them for the interests
of the rest of Europe, that the power of the
President should prevail, inasmuch as the continuance
of his authority might afford a prospect of the
maintenance of social order in France, whereas the
divisions of opinions and parties in the Assembly
appeared to betoken that their victory over the President
would be the starting-point for disastrous civil
strife." Lord John Russell said that this dispatch
contained no satisfactory explanation of Lord Palmerston's
course; that the merits of the French government
had now nothing to do with the case: but
that the real question was, whether the Secretary
of State was entitled of his own authority, to write
a dispatch, as the organ of the Government, in
which his colleagues had never concurred, and to
which the Queen had never given her sanction. He
thought, therefore, that he could not without degrading
the Crown, advise her Majesty longer to retain
Lord Palmerston in the Foreign department, and he
had accordingly advised her to request his resignation,
which she had done. In continuing his remarks
Lord John expressed his belief that the President
of France had acted under a belief that the course
he had taken was the one best calculated to insure
the welfare of his country; and proceeded to censure
the course of the English press toward Louis Napoleon,
as calculated to excite the animosity of the
French nation, and perhaps to involve the two countries
in war. Lord Palmerston replied in a very
moderate tone, substantially admitting the truth of
Lord John's statements, though denying the justice
of his inferences. He repelled the intimation that
he had abandoned the principles he had always
maintained&mdash;that he had become the advocate of absolute
power, or in favor of the abolition of Constitutional
governments. He concurred in what Lord
John had said of the relations that ought to exist between
the Foreign Secretary and the Crown, and
said he had done nothing inconsistent with them.
In regard to the deputation he had received, he admitted
that he had been surprised into a false position.
His delay in answering the letters of Lord
John Russell had been entirely owing to the great
pressure of business; and his expressions of opinion
concerning Louis Napoleon were unofficial and in
conversation. Other members of the cabinet had expressed
the same opinions, and under circumstances
quite as objectionable, certainly, as those under
which his own conversation was held. Lord Palmerston
rehearsed the outlines of the policy he
had pursued in managing the foreign relations of
Great Britain, and concluded by saying that, on
quitting office, he left the character and reputation
of England unsullied, and standing high among the
nations of the world.&mdash;&mdash;In the House of Lords the
debates following the reading of the Queen's speech,
had greater incidental than direct interest. The
Earl of Derby took occasion to speak in very strong
terms of what he termed "the injudicious and unjustifiable
language of a large portion of the English
press upon the French government." He insisted
that it was the duty of the press to maintain the
same tone of moderation in discussing public affairs
which is required of public men; and he styled it
worse than folly for the press in one breath to provoke
a French invasion, and in the next to proclaim the
unpreparedness of the English people to meet it.
He was followed by Earl Grey, who expressed his
hearty concurrence in what he had said of the press,
as did also Lord Brougham. The London journals,
and among them pre-eminently the <i>Times</i> and the
<i>Examiner</i>, have taken up the challenge thus thrown
down, and have vindicated the press from the censures
of the Lords in some of the ablest writing of the day.</p>

<p>On the 9th, Lord John Russell introduced his
new Reform Bill. Its provisions may be very briefly
stated. The &pound;10 franchise was to be reduced to &pound;5;
the &pound;50 county franchise gives way to one of &pound;20;
that of copyholders and long leaseholders is to be
reduced from &pound;10 to &pound;5; and a new class of voters
is to be created out of those who, resident in either
county or borough, pay direct taxes to the amount of
<a class="pagenum" id="page_696" title="pg 696"></a>
40 shillings. In 67 boroughs additions are proposed
to the electoral boundaries; the property qualification
is to be abolished, and the oaths of members to be put
in such a form as to create no invidious distinctions.
A member taking office under the crown vacates his
seat; but if he merely changes it, he may retain his
representative capacity. The Premier made a speech
upon the subject, over an hour in length, and remarkably
free from feeling of any sort. The main objections
urged to the bill are that it does not concede
the ballot, that it does not remedy the evils of unequal
representation, and that the changes it does make in
the existing law are of very little importance. Notice
has been given of an intention to move amendments
to the bill which would remedy these defects.&mdash;&mdash;On
the 19th, Lord Naas proposed a resolution severely
censuring the Earl of Clarendon's employment of the
<i>World</i> newspaper to support the government, as being
"of a nature to weaken the authority of the executive,
and to reflect discredit on the administration
of public affairs." The Earl was defended warmly
by Lords Russell and Palmerston, both of whom
urged that, irregular as the proceeding might have
been, it was of trifling consequence compared with
his lordship's eminent services to the country. The
resolution was rejected 229 to 137.&mdash;&mdash;On the 16th,
Lord John Russell introduced a bill for the establishment
of a local militia force. He gave a sketch of
the recent history of the military organization of England,
and set forth the reasons which, in his judgment,
rendered it important that some more effectual
provision should be made for the defense of the country
against possible hostilities. The general provisions
of the bill were that persons of the age of 20
and 21 years should be subject to being balloted for
as militia men&mdash;that one-fifth of the whole number
should be chosen&mdash;and that they should be drilled for
14 or 28 days each year. The entire force thus raised,
he thought, would be about 70,000 the first year,
100,000 the second, and 130,000 after that; the forces
could not be taken out of their own counties, without
their consent, except in case of invasion or danger.
The subject was very slightly discussed at that time,
but came up again on the 20th, when Lord John Russell
again spoke in support of the bill. Lord Palmerston
expressed his entire concurrence in the principle
of the bill, but moved as an amendment, to strike
out the word <i>local</i> from the title, in order to make the
title correspond with the character of the bill itself.
Lord John Russell said he could not understand the
object of such a motion, and that he should oppose it.
After some further debate the amendment was put
and carried, ayes 136, noes 125, showing a majority
against the Ministry of 11. Lord John Russell expressed
great surprise at the vote, and said that he
should hold office no longer. The resignation of the
Ministry under such circumstances created a good
deal of surprise. In the course of three or four days
a new cabinet was formed under the leadership of
the Earl of Derby&mdash;late Lord Stanley&mdash;which is
thoroughly Protectionist in its sentiments. The
Earl is Prime Minister; Mr. Disraeli is Chancellor
of the Exchequer and leader in the House of Commons;
Mr. G. F. Young is Vice President of the
Board of Trade; Duke of Northumberland, first Lord
of the Admiralty; Lord John Manners, Commissioner
of Woods and Forests; Sir F. Thesiger, Attorney
General; Earl of Eglintoun, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland;
Duke of Montrose, Lord Steward; Lord Stanley,
Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs. It is supposed
that the new Ministry will break ground at
once against the corn-law policy established by Sir
Robert Peel, hostility to which is the only bond of
union among its members; and the universal belief
is that the new administration will fail to be sustained
by the country on that question.</p>

<p>One of the earliest topics to which the attention
of the Earl of Granville, Lord Palmerston's immediate
successor, was called, was the degree of protection
which England should afford to political
refugees from other countries. In reply to representations
on this subject from the Austrian Government,
Earl Granville, in a dispatch dated January 13, spoke
of the right of asylum which England always had
granted, and could never refuse to political refugees;
and added that the English government would, nevertheless,
consider any intrigues, carried on there against
governments with which they were at peace, as a
breach of hospitality, and would not fail to watch the
conduct of suspected refugees, and to prevent them
from abusing the privileges afforded them by English
laws. Prince Schwarzenberg, in reply, expressed
satisfaction at the tenor of these assurances, but
said, that until the words of the English government
were followed by deeds, it would be necessary for
Austria to take measures of precaution and protection
against the dangers which the ceaseless machinations
of foreign refugees on English soil created. The
Imperial government would be especially rigid in
regard to English travelers, and would, moreover,
reserve the right of taking into consideration ulterior
measures, if, unhappily, the need of them should still
make itself felt.&mdash;&mdash;A terrible disaster from floods
occurred in the north of England on the 5th of February.
Several of the factories of the town of Holmfrith,
near Huddersfield, were supplied with water
by large reservoirs, in which an immense body of
water had been accumulated. Owing to the heavy
rains one of the largest of them broke its banks, and
the water poured through the town, sweeping houses
away in its path and causing an immense loss of life
and property. Over one hundred persons were
drowned. Very great injury had been sustained by
other towns in that vicinity. In the south of Ireland
also, especially in the counties of Limerick and
Clare, much property and some lives have been lost
by the swelling of the smaller streams.&mdash;&mdash;The dispatches
of Earl Grey recalling Sir Harry Smith from
the government of the Cape, have been published:
they show that his incompetence for the post has
been the real cause of his removal, and that the
policy of the government is to prosecute the war
with increased vigor, so as to reduce the Kaffirs and
Hottentots to unconditional submission.&mdash;&mdash;We mentioned
in our Record for March, the repulse of the
English slave squadron while attempting to ascend
the river, to the town of Lagos, on the coast of
Africa, contrary to the commands of the chief. Later
advices report the renewal of the attempt, and the
overthrow of the chief's authority, though at a very
heavy cost on the part of the English. The town of
Lagos has long been the stronghold of the slave trade
on that part of the coast, and the English have directed
their efforts toward the suppression of the traffic
there. The chief of the town named Kosoko, was
actively engaged in the trade himself, in connection
with Portugese and Brazilian dealers. He had obtained
power by expelling a rival named Akitoye,
who sought aid against him in an alliance with the
English. When Kosoko, therefore, refused permission
to the English to bring their armed boats to
Lagos, the commander of the squadron concerted an
attack upon the town, with the adherents of the expelled
chief. The town was defended with a good
deal of skil and bravery, and the assault upon it
lasted three days, at the end of which time it was
<a class="pagenum" id="page_697" title="pg 697"></a>
found to have been deserted. The English lost 16
killed and 64 wounded. It is said that the destruction
of this town will do much toward the suppression of
the slave trade.&mdash;&mdash;A new expedition in search of Sir
John Franklin has been resolved upon by the British
Government, and Sir Edward Belcher has been appointed
to the command. He will leave England
about the middle of April, with the four ships which
composed Captain Austin's late expedition. His
attention will first be directed to Beechey Island,
where Sir John is known to have passed the winter
of 1845-6. The great object of this new expedition
is to examine the upper part of Wellington Strait as
far as possible beyond Captain Penny's northwest
advance.</p>

<h3>FRANCE.</h3>

<p>Political affairs in France remain substantially unchanged.
The law organizing the Legislative body
has been published. The Legislature is to consist
of 261 deputies, elected by the people, in the proportion
of one for every 35,000 electors in the first instance,
with one more deputy for every 25,000 beyond
that number. Algeria and the Colonies are not
to be represented. All electors are eligible except
public functionaries. Every Frenchman of the age
of twenty-one, who has not forfeited his civil rights,
has the vote.&mdash;&mdash;We mentioned in our last Record the
protest of the testamentary executors of Louis Philippe
against the decree of confiscation, issued by the
President. The Princes of Orleans&mdash;the Duke de
Nemours, and the Prince de Joinville&mdash;have addressed
a letter of thanks to the executors, in which
they resent with becoming indignation the insults
heaped upon the memory of their father, which they
say are "especially odious when brought forward
by a man who on two different occasions received
proofs of the magnanimity of King Louis Philippe,
and whose family never received any thing from him
but benefits." To the honor of the country which
they had always loyally served and would ever love,
they say, "these disgraceful decrees, and their still
more disgraceful preambles, have not dared to appear
except under the <i>r&eacute;gime</i> of a state of siege, and
after the suppression of all the guaranties which protected
the liberties of the nation." The Duchess of
Orleans has also addressed the following brief and
indignant protest to the President:&mdash;"Monsieur&mdash;As
I do not acknowledge your right to plunder my family,
neither do I acknowledge your right to assign to
me a dotation in the name of France. I refuse the
dowry.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Helena d'Orleans.</span>"&mdash;&mdash;The new Ministry
of Police has been organized by decree. The
Minister is to have attached to his office three directors-general,
who are to appoint inspector-general,
special inspectors, and commissaries of police in the
departments. Prominent among the duties of all of
these officials are those of watching and reporting
every attempt to influence public opinion against the
government, keeping a close eye on the press and on
publications of every sort&mdash;upon theatres, prisons,
schools, and political and commercial associations.
They are all to be under the immediate direction and
control of the Minister of Police. The organization
spreads a complete network of precaution over every
form of public opinion in France.&mdash;&mdash;Louis Napoleon
gave a magnificent entertainment to a large number
of the English nobility at Paris, on the 1st of February,
at the Elys&eacute;e&mdash;-the whole party numbering 44.
It is stated that after the dinner was over, he took
occasion to complain of the attacks upon him in the
English press, and to say that he should be obliged to
exclude them from France. He also spoke of the rumors
that he intended to invade England as absurd.&mdash;&mdash;Jerome
Bonaparte is appointed President of the
Senate, with the <i>petit</i> Luxembourg as his official residence
in Paris, the Palace of Meudon for his country-seat,
and a salary of 150,000 francs, besides
800,000 francs for entertaining, a year.&mdash;&mdash;It is
stated that Madame George Sand recently had an
interview with the President, and made very strong
representations to him of the sufferings of the peasantry
in the rural districts from the immense number
of arrests that had been made of suspected persons,
and urgently requesting him to grant a general amnesty.
The President is said to have expressed
great interest in the subject, but to have declined
any compliance with the request.&mdash;&mdash;The decree for
the regulation of the press has been promulgated. It
is almost needless to say that it destroys every semblance
of freedom of the press, and makes it a mere
subservient tool in the hands of the Government. It
consists of four chapters, and the following are their
provisions: (1.) No journal can be published without
first obtaining permission of the Government; nor can
any foreign journal be admitted into France except
by the same permission: and any person bringing
into France an unauthorized paper will be liable to
a year's imprisonment and to a fine of 5000 francs.
Every publisher must deposit caution-money, from
15,000 to 50,000 francs, before he can issue a paper,
under heavy penalties. (2.) Stamp duties are imposed
upon all journals whether published in France,
or introduced from other countries; and the authorities
are enjoined to seize all publications violating
these regulations. (3.) Every violation of the article
of the Constitution which prohibits Legislative
reports, is punishable by fine of from 1000 to 5000
francs. The publication of false news subjects to
a fine, and if it be of a tendency to disturb the
public peace, imprisonment is added. No account
of the proceedings of the Senate or Council of
State, and no report of trials for press offenses, can
be published; and in all affairs, civil, correctional,
or criminal, the courts may forbid the publication of
their proceedings. Every editor is bound to publish
official documents, relations, and rectifications which
may be addressed to him by any public authority; if he
fail to do so, he may be fined and his journal seized
No one can carry on the bookseller's trade, or issue or
sell engravings, medals, or prints of any kind, without
obtaining permission of the authorities, and becoming
subject to the same restrictions as are imposed upon
journals. (4.) With regard to existing journals, three
months are allowed for them to deposit the caution
money required, and to conform to the other provisions
of the new law.&mdash;&mdash;The President, by decree, has
abolished all f&ecirc;te days except the birth-day of the
Emperor, on the ground that their celebration recalls
the remembrance of civil discord; and that the only
one observed should be that which best tends to unite
all minds in the common sentiment of national glory&mdash;&mdash;The
Paris correspondent of the London <i>Times</i>
reports that a correspondence of general interest has
taken place between the governments of France and
Russia. It is said that the Czar wrote to his minister
in Paris, expressing dissatisfaction at the adoption
by the President of the emblems of the Empire,
stating that he saw in all these movements the preliminaries
of the re-establishment of the Imperial era.
While he approved of the <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i> which had put
an end to republicanism in France, he could only
regard Louis Napoleon as the temporary chief, and
could not approve any attempt to give another and
more important character to his authority. It is said
that Louis Napoleon replied to this note, when it was
read to him, by complaining that his intentions had
<a class="pagenum" id="page_698" title="pg 698"></a>
been misunderstood and misrepresented;&mdash;that, in
re-establishing the emblems of the Empire, and in
reverting to the constitution of the year VIII., he only
meant to establish a strong authority in his hands;
that the recollections of the Empire constituted his
strength, and invested him with popularity among the
masses; that there was nothing astonishing in the
fact of his seeking in the institutions of the Empire
what was certain to re-establish authority in France;
that he had no intention of re-establishing the Empire,
or of making himself Emperor; that he did not
want either, for the accomplishment of the mission to
which he had been called; that his title of President
sufficed for him; that he had no reason to trouble
himself about an Imperial dynasty which has no existence;
and that there was no reason for the Emperor
Nicholas troubling himself about it.</p>

<p>The relations of France to Belgium are assuming
a character of considerable interest and importance.
The fact that most of the exiled Frenchmen found
refuge in Belgium, excited the fears of the government
that they would thence exert a dangerous influence
upon French affairs. Strong representations
were therefore made to the Belgian authorities, who
have adopted every possible means of satisfying the
French government, by suppressing distrusted journals,
exercising strict vigilance over refugees, and
ordering many of them out of the country, or away
from Brussels. It is also stated that the Duke of
Bassano, the new French envoy to the Belgian court,
has been authorized to demand from that government
the removal of the monumental lion erected by the
British government to commemorate the battle of
Waterloo, and to demolish the other trophies. The
rumors of hostile designs on the part of Louis Napoleon,
have led to the publication of an official denial
in the <i>Moniteur</i>. That article states that the French
government has addressed no demands whatever to
foreign powers, excepting Belgium, where it was
necessary, in order to prevent a system of incessant
aggression. It has not armed a single soldier, neither
has it done any thing to awaken the least susceptibility
in its neighbors. All the views of the power in
France are bent upon interior improvements. "It
will not depart from its calm demeanor, except on the
day when an attack shall have been made on the national
honor and dignity." The London <i>Morning
Chronicle</i> states, as a fact of considerable historical
interest, that, as early as 1849, Louis Napoleon distinctly
solicited General Changamier to join with
him in such a usurpation as he has since achieved,
offering to make him Constable of France, with a million
of francs a year and the palace of the Elys&eacute;e for
a residence; and that he was met by a peremptory
refusal.</p>

<h3>SPAIN.</h3>

<p>An attempt to assassinate the Queen of Spain was
made by a priest named Martin Marino, on the 2d of
February. The Queen was proceeding along the
principal gallery of her palace toward the grand staircase,
intending to go out upon a f&ecirc;te occasion, for
which splendid preparations had been made, when
she was approached by the priest, who kneeled to
present a memorial. Her Majesty reached out her
hand to take it, when he suddenly drew a dirk and
made a stab at her side. Her arm, however, partially
averted the blow, though she was severely wounded.
She leaned against the wall, and one of her aids
came up just in time to prevent a second blow. The
assassin was arrested and confessed the crime&mdash;saying
that his object was to render a service to humanity;
and denying that he had any accomplices. He
was tried on the 3d, and sentenced to death by
strangulation. On the 7th, he was executed by the
<i>garote vil</i>. He conducted himself with the most brutal
indifference, refusing any of the usual offices of religion,
and abusing all who came near him. The
Queen suffered considerably from the wound, but
was convalescent at the last accounts. Several arrests
had been made, of persons suspected of having
been concerned as accomplices with him, but no evidence
was found to implicate any.</p>

<h3>CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE.</h3>

<p>
o events of special importance have occurred in
any of the continental nations. All the governments
seem to be more or less agitated by rumors of differences
with England and France, and their policy is
somewhat affected by them. The suspicion of hostile
intentions on the part of Louis Napoleon toward
Belgium has enlisted a good deal of suspicion, and
letters from Brussels, dated the 19th February, state
positively that a convention had been entered into,
by which Russia agrees to furnish 100,000 men for
the defense of that territory in case it should be invaded
or seriously menaced by France. Prussia has
also promised similar assistance, and the Prince de
Ligne is said to be now in Berlin for the purpose of
arranging the details. These important statements,
however, do not seem to be made on authority sufficient
to command full credit.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Austria</span>, it is said, that Prince Schwartzenberg
is preparing a general statement of the views of Austria
concerning the state of Europe, and an indication
of the line of policy which she will pursue. The mediation
of Austria between Sardinia and the Pope
has also been proposed, and amicable relations are
again to be established between the Sardinian and
Austrian governments. A new treaty has been concluded,
by which Austria is to supply Russia annually
with large quantities of salt.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Switzerland</span> the only movements of importance
relate to the demand made by the French government
that the Council should promise hereafter
to expel any fugitive who might be designated as
dangerous. The Federal Government, while firmly
refusing to enter into any such engagement, avowed
its readiness to take all proper and necessary precautions
against the sojourn of political refugees in
Switzerland becoming a source of disquietude to
neighboring states. An official report on the subject
states that in June last there were but 235 political
refugees in the Swiss states, and that they were all
under the strict <i>surveillance</i> of the police. Those who
had taken any active steps likely to compromise the
interests of other states, had been promptly expelled.
There was a great deal of public interest manifested
throughout Switzerland concerning the relations between
their country and France, and considerable
apprehension prevailed that their rights and liberties
might not always be rigidly respected.</p>

<p>The government of the Duchy of <span class="smcap">Holstein</span> was
formally transferred by the Commissaries of Prussia
and Austria to the Commissary of Denmark, Count
Reventlow-Criminil, on the 8th of February, in an
official conference held at Kiel.</p>

<p>In both <span class="smcap">Greece</span> and <span class="smcap">Turkey</span> there have been
changes of Ministry. In the former country the
change has no general importance. In Turkey, it is
significant of reaction. Reschid Pacha, the most liberal
and enlightened minister ever placed at the head
of affairs in the Ottoman empire, has been dismissed,
and is succeeded by Raaf Pacha, a man upward of
eighty years of age, who was prime minister in 1838.
The negotiation in regard to the Holy Sepulchre has
been abandoned, and the French minister was to
leave Constantinople forthwith.

<h2 class="olde" id="Editors_Table">Editor's Table.</h2>

<p  class="drop">Science, it has been said, is essentially unpoetical.
It must be acknowledged, nevertheless,
that it not unfrequently furnishes some of our choicest
similes. Homer had, indeed, long ago compared
thought to the lightning; but how much more definite,
and, on this account, more effective, is the kindred
simile drawn from the discovery of the modern electric
telegraph. And yet, is there not here something
more than simile? Is not the communication from
soul to soul literally, as well as figuratively <i>tele-graphic</i>,
that is, <i>far-writing</i>, or <i>writing from afar</i>? We
hope to interest our readers by a brief examination
of the query we have started.</p>

<p>An identity might, perhaps, be shown in the very
medium of communication, so far as the process has
a material medium. There is no difficulty, and no
danger, in admitting that the electric fluid may be the
agent in the cerebral and organic transmission, as
well as in the galvanic battery. But it is mainly in
the process itself that we may trace the striking correspondence
between the two modes of intelligence.
The primary element of all thought is a spiritual
<i>emotion</i>. The end of all communication, mediate or
immediate, is to produce the same emotion or feeling
in another soul. To this every other step is subordinate.
Even thought is not so much an end, in itself,
as is the spiritual feeling, or exercise of soul
corresponding to it. This spiritual emotion, then,
must first be brought under the form of a conception,
or an objective picture, without which it can not be
distinctly read and understood, even by the soul in
which it first exists, much less communicated to another.
So far the process is strikingly the same with
that adopted in the telegraphic dispatch. The soul,
by its own spiritual energy, first turns the emotion
or feeling into a thought. It translates the thought
from the abstract to the concrete, from the intuitional
to the conceptive. It brings it down into the
soul's chamber of imagery, and imprints it on the
brain. In other words, the message is reduced to
writing and given to the clerk at the station-house,
who translates it into telegraphic signals. The more
immediate transmitting power is now set in operation.
An influence is imparted from the brain to the
nerves (or wires) of the vocal organs. It is continued
to the lungs, and sets in motion a current of
air. This impinges on the outward atmosphere, and
is carried on through successive undulations until it
reaches the other station for which it was designed.
It enters the office-chamber of the ear, communicates
with the other cerebral battery, and then writes off
from the auditory nerve or wire, the signals which,
by the other logical and linguistic faculty, or the
clerk at the second station, are translated into the
pictorial symbols understood by all, and thus written
on the second brain. The spiritual inhabitant to
whom it is directed, again translates it, in a reverse
order, from the verbal to the conceptive, from the
conceptive to the emotional&mdash;the intuition is spiritually
<i>seen</i>&mdash;the emotion is <i>felt</i>&mdash;and thus the circuit
is completed.</p>

<p>This is substantially the process every time we
hold intercourse by means of speech. The operation
is ever imperfect in all, and more imperfect in some
than in others. We make mistakes in translating
our own intuitions and emotions. We make still
greater mistakes in taking off from the wires, and in
re-translating the conceptual language which brings
to us the feelings and intuitions of others. But there
is no other way. The author of our spiritual and
material constitution hath literally <i>shut us up</i> to this,
and we can not get out of the limits within which
He has confined our intercourse with other spirits.
Clairvoyance boasts of having broken through them,
or over them; but clairvoyance is yet a fact to be
established. Even, too, if it has any claims upon
our belief, it will doubtless be found, in the end, to
be only a stenographic shortening of some of the steps,
without being, in reality, any more an <i>immediate</i> action
of mind upon mind than the ordinary process.</p>

<p>Spirit can only communicate with spirit through
outward symbols, and by more or less steps, all of
which may be regarded as <i>outward</i> to the most interior
effect. By long familiarity this circuitous
chain assumes to us the appearance of directness.
But in truth we never see each other; we never
hear each other; if by the terms be meant our very
<i>self</i>&mdash;our very spiritual form, our very spiritual voice.
Even to our human soul may be accommodated without
irreverence the language which Paul applies to
the Deity. Even of us it may be said, although in a
far lower sense, "<i>Our invisible things are only understood
by the things that are done</i>," even our temporal
power and humanity. Each soul is <i>shut up</i> in an
isolation as perfect, in one sense, as that which separates
the far distant worlds in the universe. Had
there been round each one of us a wall of adamant a
thousand feet in thickness, with only the smallest
capillary apertures through which to carry the wires
of telegraphic signals, we could not, as to the essential
action of the spirit, be more secluded than we
are at present. We say the essential, or first action
of the soul&mdash;for doubtless there may be various degrees
of difficulty or facility in the modes of mediate
communication. But in this more spiritual sense
each one of us exists by himself. We live apart in
utter loneliness. The seclusion of each spirit knows
no infraction. Its perfect solitude has never been
invaded by any foreign intrusion.</p>

<p>To one who deeply reflects on the fact to which
we have been calling attention, the first feeling, and
a just feeling too, might be one of pride. The dignity
of our nature would seem enhanced by such a
constitution. Each man's "mind is his kingdom,"
in which he may be as autocratic as he wills. It
makes even the lowest in the scale of humanity such
an absolute sovereign within his own spiritual boundaries,
so perfectly secure, if he please, against all
foreign intervention. It sets in so striking a light
what in its physical and etymological, rather than its
moral sense, may be styled the <i>holiness</i>&mdash;<i>the wholeness</i>,
<i>hale-ness</i>, or <i>separate integrity</i> of each man's essential
being. It is in this point of view, too, that to
every hale mind the pretensions of clairvoyance must
appear so inexpressibly revolting. We allude to its
assumption of having the power of committing what,
for the want of a better name, we can only characterize
as spiritual burglary&mdash;in other words, of
breaking into our spiritual house, and taking its seat
in the very shrine of the interior consciousness.
What can be more degrading to our human nature
than to admit that any other human power, or human
will, can at any time, and from any motive, even for
purposes of the most frivolous amusement, actually
enter this inner sanctuary, turning the immortal
spirit into a paltry show-house, and rudely invading,
or pretending to invade, the soul's essential glory, its
sacred and unapproachable individuality?
<a class="pagenum" id="page_700" title="pg 700"></a></p>

<p>There is, however, another aspect of the thought
in which it may give rise to a very different, if not
an opposite emotion. There may be, too, at times,
a feeling of the deepest melancholy called out by that
other consideration of our spiritual solitude, of our
being so utterly alone upon the earth&mdash;a feeling
which has never been set forth with so much power
and, at the same time, truthful simplicity, as in the
touching language of inspiration&mdash;"<i>The heart knoweth
its own bitterness, and a stranger meddleth not with
its joy.</i>" And then, again, although we would in
general shrink from it as a painful ordeal, there are
periods when we long for a more searching communion
with other spirits than can ever be expected
from the most intimate methods of mediate intercourse.
There are periods when we are irresistibly
drawn out to say&mdash;O that some other soul were acquainted
with us as we think we are acquainted
with ourselves, not only with our fancied virtues and
our mere real sins, as they appear imperfectly manifested
by misinterpreted signals from within, but with
our very soul itself. Yes, there is sadness in the
thought that we are so unknown, even to those who
would be thought to know us best&mdash;unknown alike in
that which makes us better as in that which makes
us worse than we seem;&mdash;for we are all better, and
we are all worse than we appear to our fellow-men.</p>

<p>And here, we think, may be found an argument
for the existence of Deity, built on stronger and more
assuring ground than is furnished by any of the ordinary
positions of natural theology. It is an argument
derived from one of the most interior wants of
our moral constitution. There is no doubt that in
our fallen state a feeling of pain&mdash;at times of intense
pain&mdash;may connect itself in our minds with the recognition
of the Divine idea; but there is also an
element of happiness, and, if cherished, of the highest
and most serious happiness, in the thought that
there is One Great Soul that does penetrate into our
most interior spirituality. There is one Soul that is
ever as intimately present with us as our own consciousness&mdash;that
holds communion with us, and with
whom we may hold communion, in a manner impossible
for any other. There is One that thinks our
thoughts, and feels our feelings, even as we think
them, and as we feel them, although, along with
this, in another manner, too, of its own, that transcends
our thinking "even as the heavens are high
above the earth," and is as far removed from all the
imperfections of our own spiritual exercises. There
may seem an inconsistency in this apparent mingling
of the finite and the infinite in the Divine Nature,
but it is the belief of both which unlocks for us the
meaning of the Scriptures, and sheds light over every
page of revelation and of providence. There is a
higher Soul that pervades our spiritual entity, not as
an impersonal or pantheistic abstraction, but as the
most distinctly personal of all personalities&mdash;not as
a mere Law of nature, but as a Father "who careth
for us," as a Guardian "who numbereth the very
hairs of our heads," as a Judge who taketh note of
every thought, and gives importance to all our forgotten
sins, while He is, at the same time, present
with, and caring for every other individual soul in
the universe. As in some previous musings of our
Editorial Table, we might have adverted to the Divine
physical power as the ever-present dynamical entity
in the seeming vacuities of space, and binding together
the isolated material worlds, so here we may
regard the Higher Spiritual Presence as the true
bond of union among all those isolated souls that fill
the spiritual universe. Thus viewed, the fact of
such communion would be the highest truth in
philosophy, as a belief in the reality of its possible
consciousness would be the highest article of
faith.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">History is Philosophy teaching by Example.</span></h3>

<p>The thought has been deemed so profound as to give
rise to some discussion respecting its origin. As a definition,
however, the maxim is liable to serious objection.
It presents, rather, the uses, or the chief use,
of history, than the essential idea. The individual
memory may also be said to be <i>philosophy teaching by
example</i>; but then it becomes only another name for
that experience which is but the application of remembered
facts to the guidance of the future life. So
history may be called <span class="smcap">the World's Memory</span>&mdash;the
memory of a race&mdash;of a nation&mdash;of a collective humanity.</p>

<p>It is in vain, then, for us to say what facts, in
themselves, <i>ought</i> to constitute history. The matter
is settled. It is not what any philosophy, or any theology,
or any science of history may deem <i>worthy</i> of
remembrance, but what has actually been thus remembered,
or is now so entering into the common
mind as to form the ground of memory in the future.
The parallelism in this respect between the individual
and this national, or common mind, is striking and
complete. The true history of each man is not so
much what he has done, as what he has thought and
felt. The thought is the <i>form</i> of the feeling, and the
act merely the outward testimony by which both are
revealed. It is not, therefore, every act, or <i>doing</i>,
which enters into his history&mdash;not even those which
have formed the greater part of his constant daily exercise&mdash;but
simply such as for any reason have made
the deepest impression on the inner man, and which,
therefore, stand out in the records of his memory
when all else has perished. What this chronicles is
the man's veritable history. However important other
parts of his conduct may appear externally, this is
his true spiritual life. It is the record, the imperishable
record of that which has reached and stirred the
depths of his soul, while other acts, and other events,
have had their lodgment only in the outward un-emotional
existence.</p>

<p>Such memory, or such history, may not be what it
ought to have been; it may not be the measure of accountability.
All that we insist upon is the fact,
that, whether right or wrong, it is the true history of
the individual, because it is his real life. But then
there are degrees of memory. It is not always, in
all its parts, either present to the mind, or capable of
recall at will. Still, what has once in this manner
truly <i>affected</i> his soul, has by this become a part of it,
and can, therefore, never be lost. Like some old historical
record it may be laid aside for a season, but
sooner or later must it come forth, and claim its
place as belonging to that individual personality into
which it enters as a constituent and inseparable portion.</p>

<p>The parallel may be traced to almost any extent.
Like the memory of our earliest years, so is the dawning
history of a young world or nation, except so far
as positive revelation has shed its light upon it. Both
are <i>mythical</i>. In other words, facts are remembered,
not as they are in themselves, but as seen through
the magnifying and coloring influence of the emotional
medium with which they are ever afterward associated.
Like stars observed through a densely refracting
atmosphere, they stand apart, each in its own
seclusion, and hence they loom upon the vision without
any of those mutually connecting associations
that belong to our subsequent thinking. There is,
too, in both cases, the same chronicler&mdash;the pure remembrance,
<a class="pagenum" id="page_701" title="pg 701"></a>
a <i>tradition</i> unaided by any of those outward
helps that are afterward employed. At a later
period more regular annals succeed this mythic handing
down of isolated facts. The state has its formal
remembrancer, its συγγραφεύς, or historical <i>arranger</i>
of events in a <i>connected</i> story, and in their mutual relations.
Corresponding to this, then, arises in the individual
that orderly habit of thinking which produces
associations, having a similar effect in causing a
stricter union between the outer and inner relations
of the soul.</p>

<p>Again, there are times when the man gets to himself
what may be called an <i>artificial</i> memory. He
would change the natural flow of thought, and determine
what he <i>will</i> remember, and what he <i>ought</i> to
remember&mdash;forgetting that before he can effectually
do this he must be changed himself in the innermost
springs of his being. He studies mnemonics. He
manufactures new laws of association. But this
effort ever fails in the end. Nature will have her
way. The old course of memory will return; and
with it the spiritual history of the man will go on
as before.</p>

<p>So, too, the state or nation may have its artificial
periods, and its systems of political mnemonics. The
mythical, the epic, the heroic, and not only these, but
the later, yet not less thrilling chronicles of stirring
events that carried with them the whole heart of the
national humanity, give way to statistics, and documents
of trade, or tables of revenue, or in a word, to
what are deemed the more important records of <i>political
economy</i>. Here, too, there may be an attempt to
change the course of nature, and make that to be history
which never can be such, except at the expense
of some of those attributes, which, although liable to
great and dangerous perversions, are still the noblest
parts of our humanity.</p>

<p>Such artificial records of history may be highly useful
in their connection with the interests of particular
classes and occupations. The time also may come
in which they may gather around them an antiquarian
value, blending with some of the more universal emotions
of our common nature. But aside from this, although
they may furnish rich materials for other departments
of useful knowledge, they are not history,
simply because they lack that catholic element, by
which alone they enter into the common memory,
and thus become a part of the common national
mind.</p>

<p>Some say the world has heretofore been all wrong
in the matter. History has been but a record of wars,
of tumultuous national movements, of theological dogmas,
of religious and political excitements. It has
been but the biography of monarchs and royal families,
or a narrative of popular commotions as connected
with them. It has presented us only with
names of isolated pre-eminence. The time has now
come when we "must change all that." The daily
pursuits of the masses, and all the statistics of ordinary
life&mdash;these ought to have been history, and good
writers will henceforth make them so, not only for
our times, but for the periods that are past. "The
history of the world," it has been said, "is yet to be
written." But, alas! for these plausible and philanthropic
reforms, there are two serious obstacles in
the way. In the first place, the records of such matters
as they would make the grounds of history are
too scanty and uncertain, because they never have
had that catholic interest which would give them an
abiding place in the common national memory. In
the second place, it will be equally difficult to secure
for them such lodgment in the universal thinking of
the present age, or of ages yet to come. Not that the
world will always continue the same, or that there
will not be ever new matters of genuine historical interest.
The course of things and thinking may greatly change.
Wars may cease. Monarchy may expire.
Even democracies may become obsolete. Such
changes may be for the better or the worse. Faith
may go out. Those religious dogmas and discussions,
which politicians and political economists have
regarded as such useless and troublesome intruders
into the province of history, may lose their hold upon
the mind. Still our essential position remains unchanged.
It will not be what the masses severally
<i>do</i> but what <i>moves</i> the masses, not their <i>several</i> occupations
and pursuits, but what has a deep and moving
interest for the common national soul, that will
constitute history. The wars of the White and Red
Roses were the true history of England for that period,
because they were the only subjects that could be
said to occupy all minds alike. It was not because
the chronicler forgot the masses, and thought only of
the great, but because he wrote for the masses, and
for the masses not only of his own time, but of times
to come.</p>

<p>Events may have more or less of a personal connection
with monarchs, but it would not follow from
this that the history which records them is a history
alone of kings and statesmen. It is only so far as
they and their acts were the representatives of the
national heart, and the national thought, that they
came down in the national memory, and the national
records. The separate ordinary pursuits of men may,
in one sense, occupy more of our ordinary thinking,
but the other or historic interest we recognize as being
of a higher, a more exciting, and even a more absorbing
kind, because belonging to us, and felt by us
in common with multitudes of other souls. The mechanic
or farmer may consult books of a professional
or statistical nature, but <i>as history</i> they will be ever
unreadable. Even in the workshop and in the field,
although the habitual current of his thoughts may be
upon what would seem to him the nearest, and therefore
the more important concerns of life, these other
elements of history will yet have the greater charm,
and occupy a higher place both in his feelings and his
intelligence.</p>

<p>It is what he thinks <i>with others</i> that constitutes
the higher life of his being. Hence the tendency
of the popular mind, in all ages, to be absorbed
in the recital of deeds most remote from the daily
associations of ordinary life. Hence the popularity
of the rhapsodist, the minstrel, the chronicler, and,
in our own age, of the Magazine and the Newspaper.
Hence, too, in the more free and popular governments
of modern times, the universal devotion to
what is called <i>politics</i>. Why is the farmer more excited
by an election than by the sale of his wheat?
Most false as well as unphilosophical is the view
which would ascribe this to any calculating patriotism,
to any utilitarian vigilance, or to what is commonly
called an <i>enlightened self-interest</i>. The mechanic
thinks more of politics than of his trade; for
the same reason that led his ancestor to the crusade
or the tournament. Instead of being the offspring of
utilitarian views, this <i>public spirit</i> is often most blindly
destructive of the <i>private</i> interest, and most directly
opposed to all the teachings of that political economy
which recognizes its own utilities as alone the
true and rational ends of human action. In a much
higher sense, too, is all this true, when a religious
element enters into the common or catholic feeling.</p>

<p>To illustrate the view we have endeavored to present,
let us select some particular date&mdash;say the 5th
day of March, in the year of our Lord one thousand
<a class="pagenum" id="page_702" title="pg 702"></a>
seven hundred and seventy. What was the history
of our own country for that day? What the masses
were doing would be the answer which some of the
new school would promptly make. But even could
this be ascertained it would not be history. On that
day the three millions of our land were engaged in
the various avocations connected with their ordinary
life and ordinary interests. On that day, too, there
was a particular, and, perhaps, ascertainable state of
agriculture, of the mechanic arts, of education, &amp;c.,
such as might furnish the ground of a most valuable
statistical essay. There were also, doubtless, thousands
of striking incidents every where transpiring.
But none of these constituted the then history of our
country. This was all taking place in one narrow
street of one single city, away off in one remote corner
of our land. A quarrel had arisen between a few
foreign soldiers and a collection of exasperated citizens,
in the course of which some few of the latter
were slain. In this event was centred, for the time,
the whole history of the English colonies in North
America, and of what afterward became the great
American nation. Among all the acts and states,
and influences of that day, this alone was history, because
it alone, whether right or not, entered into the
universal national memory. It was <i>thought</i> by all,
<i>felt</i> by all, and therefore became, for the time in
which it was so thought and felt, the one common
history of all. Again&mdash;on the 19th day of April,
1775, the one fact which afterward formed the common
thought and the common memory, was the battle
of Lexington. On the 4th of July, 1776, it was
the Declaration of American Independence. On the
23d day of September, 1780, there might have been
seen, in a secluded valley of the Hudson, three rustic
militia men busily examining the dress of a British
officer. One of them is in the act of taking a
piece of paper from the prisoner's boot. This, in a
most emphatic sense, was American history for that
day; may we not say the history of Europe also, and
of the world. And so in other departments. A single
man is standing before a company of statesmen
and ecclesiastics. It is Luther before the Diet of
Worms. This is the one common thought which represents
that momentous period in the records of the
Church. The subject tempts us with further illustrations,
but we call to mind that our Drawer and
Easy Chair are waiting impatiently for the delivery
of their contents. It is time, therefore, to exchange
the prosings of the Editor's Table for their more
varied, and, as we trust the reader will judge, more
attractive materials.</p>

<p>The town has just woke up from its wintry carnival
of sleighs and bells, and wears much the aspect
of a reveler who is paying the penalty for too free
over-night potations.  Broadway no longer flows
along like a stream of molten silver, but resembles
nothing so much as the mud-river of Styx&mdash;"darker
far than perse" of the great Florentine; and instead
of the fairy-like sleighs of the month gone by, is traversed
only by the lumbering omnibuses, scattering far
and wide the inky fluid. To cross the street dry-shod
is not to be thought of, save at one or two points
where philanthropic tradesmen, mindful of the public
good&mdash;and their own&mdash;have subsidized a troop of
sweepers to clear a passage in front of their doors.
We accept the favor with all gratitude, and do not
inquire too closely into the stories of silver goblets,
presented by grateful ladies to these public benefactors.
Under such circumstances all lighter matters
of gossip are things of the past&mdash;and of the future,
let us hope.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Into the current of graver talk several pebbles
have been thrown, which have rippled its surface
into circlets wider than usual. The meeting in commemoration
of <span class="smcap">Cooper</span> was a worthy tribute to the
memory of one who has shed honor upon his country
by adding new forms of beauty to the intellectual
wealth of the world. It was singularly graceful and
appropriate that the funeral discourse of the greatest
American Novelist, should have been pronounced by
the greatest American Poet&mdash;and should we say the
greatest living poet who speaks the tongue of Milton
and Shakspeare, who would dare to place another
name in competition for the honor with that of <span class="smcap">Bryant</span>?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Public "Lectures," or the "Lyceum," as one
of the lecturing notabilities not very felicitously denominates
the institution, had begun to assume a
somewhat mythical character in the estimation of
townsmen, as relics of ages long gone by, of which
man's memory&mdash;the Metropolitan man's, that is&mdash;takes
no note. We have indeed had rumors from
the "Athens of America," and other far-away places,
that Lectures had not fallen into utter desuetude;
but we were, on the whole, inclined to put little faith
in the reports. During the last few weeks, however,
the matter has again forced its way into the town
talk. The "Tabernacle" weekly opens its ponderous
jaws, for the delivery of the "People's Lectures,"
where, for the not very alarming sum of one
shilling&mdash;with a deduction in cases where a gentleman
is accompanied by more ladies than one&mdash;a
person may listen for an hour to the mystic elocution
and seer-like deliverances of <span class="smcap">Emerson</span>, or may hear
<span class="smcap">Kane</span> depict the dreamy remembrances of those
Hyperborean regions where sunrise and sunset are
by no means those every-day occurrences that they
are in more equatorial regions. To us, as we sit in
our Easy Chair, it seems as though this system of
cheap popular public lectures were capable of almost
indefinite expansion. Why should not <span class="smcap">Silliman</span> or
<span class="smcap">Guyot</span> address three thousand instead of three hundred
hearers? Why should they not unswathe the
world from its swaddling-clothes before an audience
which would fill our largest halls? Why should not
<span class="smcap">Orville Dewey</span> discourse on the great problems
of Human Destiny and Progress before an assemblage
which should people the cavernous depths of
the "Tabernacle," as well as before the audience,
relatively small, though doubtless fit, assembled before
the frescoes of the Church of the Messiah? We
throw these suggestions out lightly, by way of hint;
a graver consideration of them would belong rather
to our Table than to our Easy Chair discourses.</p>
<hr class="tb" />

<p>As a sort of pendant to the nine-days' talk of the
<a class="pagenum" id="page_703" title="pg 703"></a>
Forrest divorce case, we notice the unanimous verdict
of approval which has been accorded to the exemplary
damages awarded in the case of a savage
and cowardly assault committed by one of the principals
in that scandalous affair. Though no pecuniary
award can make reparation to the person who has
suffered the infliction of brutal personal outrage, yet
as long as there are ruffians whose only susceptible
point is the pocket-nerve, we are glad to see the
actual cautery applied to that sensitive point.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>If things continue much longer in their present
downward course, it will be necessary for any man
who hopes to gain acceptance in respectable society
to have it distinctly noted on his cards and letters of
introduction, that he is not a Member of either House
of Congress. The last month has been signalized at
Washington by several exhibitions of Congressional
scurrility, which in no other city in the Union would
have been tolerated beyond the limits of the lowest
dens of infamy. In one of these affairs, the summit
of impudence was crowned by one of the interlocutors,
who, after giving and receiving the most abusive
epithets, excused himself from having recourse to
the duello, that <i>ultima ratio</i>&mdash;of fools&mdash;on the plea
that he was a member of a Christian church; which
plea was magnanimously accepted by his no less
chivalrous compeer in abuse. It would be no easy
task to decide which was the most disreputable, the
"satisfaction" evaded, or the means of its evasion.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This is not the place to discuss the stringent
"Maine Liquor Law," which is proposed for adoption
in the Empire State; but we can not avoid
chronicling the almost sublime assumption of one
of its opponents, who challenged its advocates to
name any man of lofty genius who was not a "toddy-drinker."
As this side of the measure seems sadly
in want of both speakers and arguments, we consider
ourselves entitled to the gratitude of the opponents of
the law, for insinuating to them that the defense of
punch by Fielding's hero, that it was  "a good wholesome
liquor, nowhere spoken against in Scripture,"
is capable of almost indefinite extension and application.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A somewhat characteristic reminiscence of <span class="smcap">John
Newland Maffitt</span> has been lying for a long while
in our mind; and we can not do better than accord
to it the honors of paper and ink. It happened years
ago, when that eccentric preacher was in the height
of his reputation; when he was, or at least thought
he was in earnest; before the balance of his mind had
been destroyed by adulation, conceit, vanity, and
something worse.</p>

<p>During these days, in one of his journeyings, he
came to a place on the Mississippi&mdash;perhaps its name
was not <i>Woodville</i>, but that shall be its designation
for the occasion. Now, Woodville was the most notoriously
corrupt place on the whole river; it was the
sink into which all the filth of the surrounding country
was poured; it was shunned like a pest-house,
and abandoned to thieves, gamblers, desperadoes, and
robbers.</p>

<p>Maffitt determined to labor in this uninviting field.
He commenced preaching, and soon gathered an audience;
for preaching was something new there; and
besides, Maffitt's silvery tones and strange flashes of
eloquence would at that time attract an audience any
where. Those who knew the man only in his later
years know nothing of him.</p>

<p>Day after day he preached, but all to no purpose.
He portrayed the bliss of heaven&mdash;its purity and peace&mdash;in
his most rapt and glowing manner. It was the
last place which could have any charms for his Woodville
audience.</p>

<p>He portrayed the strife and turmoil of the world of
woe. Apart from its physical torments&mdash;and they
felt a sort of wild pride in defying these&mdash;they rather
liked the picture. At all events, it was much more
to their taste than was his description of heaven.</p>

<p>So it went on, day after day. Not a sigh of penitence;
not a wet eye; not a single occupant of the
anxious seat. His labors were fruitless.</p>

<p>Finally, he determined upon a change of tactics.
He spoke of the decay of Woodville; how it was
falling behind every other town on the river&mdash;"Oh!"
said he, "might but the Angel of Mercy be sent forth
from before the Great White Throne, commissioned
to proclaim to all the region round that there was a
revival in Woodville, and what a change there would
be! The people would flock here from every quarter;
the hum of business would be heard in your streets;
the steamers, whose bright wheels now go flashing
past your wharf, would stay in their fleet career;
these dense forests, which now lour around, would
be hewn down and piled up for food for these vast
leviathans; and thus a golden tide would pour in upon
you; and Woodville would become the wealthiest,
the most beautiful, and the happiest place on the
banks of the great Father of Waters!"</p>

<p>A chord had been touched in the hitherto insensible
hearts of the Woodvillers. Thought, emotion, feeling,
were aroused; and soon the strange electric
sympathy of mind with mind was excited. The emotion
spread and increased; the anxious seats were
thronged; and a powerful, and to all appearance genuine
revival of religion ensued. The character of
Woodville was entirely changed; and from that time
it has continued to be one of the most moral, quiet,
thriving, and prosperous of all the minor towns upon
the Mississippi.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Turning our eye Paris-ward, our first emotion is
one of sorrow&mdash;for their sakes and our own&mdash;at the
present sad fate of our French brethren of the quill.
The bayonet has pitted itself against the pen, and has
come off victor&mdash;for the time being. The most immediate
sufferers are doubtless political writers, who
must stretch their lucubrations upon the Procrustean
bed furnished by the Prince-President. But the
sparkling <i>feuilletonists</i> who blow up such brilliant bubbles
of romance from the prosaic soap-and-water of
every-day life, can not escape. How can Fancy have
free play when the Fate-like shears of the <i>Censure</i> or
the mace of the new press-law are suspended over its
head? Besides, the lynx-eye of despotism may detect
a covert political allusion in the most finely-wrought
romance of domestic life. The delicate touches by
which the <i>feuilletonist</i> sought to depict the fate of the
deserted girl whose body was fished up from the Seine,
may be thought to bear too strongly upon the fate of
poor <span class="smcap">Libert&eacute;</span>, betrayed and deserted by her quondam
adorer, the Nephew of his Uncle; in which case,
the writer would find himself forced to repent of his
pathos behind the gratings of a cell, while his publisher's
pocket would suffer the forfeiture of the 'caution-money.'
Parisian gossip can not, under such
circumstances, furnish us any thing very lively, but
must content itself with chronicling the brilliant but
tiresome receptions of the Elys&eacute;e.</p>

<p>An occasional claw is however protruded through
the velvet paws upon which French society creeps
along so daintily in these critical days, showing that
the propensity to scratch is not extinct, though for
the present, as far as the President and his doings
<a class="pagenum" id="page_704" title="pg 704"></a>
are concerned, "I dare not waits upon I would" in
the cat-like Parisian salon life.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The subject of gossip most thoroughly French in
its character, which has of late days passed current,
is one of which the final scene was Genoa, and the
prominent actor unfortunately an American. We
touch upon the leading points of this as they pass
current from lip to lip.</p>

<p>Our readers have no great cause of regret if they
have never before heard of, or have entirely forgotten,
a certain so-called "Chevalier" <span class="smcap">Wykoff</span>, who, a
few years since, gained an unenviable notoriety, in
certain circles in this country, as the personal attendant
of the famous <i>danseuse</i>, <span class="smcap">Fanny Elssler</span>.
Since that time the Chevalier has occasionally shown
his head above water in connection with Politics,
Literature, Fashion, and Frolic.</p>

<p>In due course of years the Chevalier grew older
if not wiser, and became anxious to assume the responsibilities
of a wife&mdash;provided that she was possessed
of a fortune. It chanced that, about these
times, a lady whom he had known for many years,
without having experienced any touches of the tender
passion, was left an orphan with a large fortune.
The sympathizing Chevalier was prompt with his
condolences at her irreparable loss, and soon established
himself in the character of confidential
friend.</p>

<p>The lady decides to visit the Continent to recruit
her shattered health. The Chevalier&mdash;sympathizing
friend that he is&mdash;is at once convinced that there is
for him no place like the Continent.</p>

<p>Having watched the pear till he supposed it fully
ripe, the ex-squire to the <i>danseuse</i> proposed to shake
the tree. One evening he announced that he must
depart on the morrow, and handed the lady a formidable
document, which he requested her to read,
and to advise him in respect to its contents.</p>

<p>The document proved to be a letter to another
lady, a friend of both parties, announcing a deliberate
intention of offering his fine person, though somewhat
the worse for wear, to the lady who was reading the
letter addressed to her friend. This proposal in the
third person met with little favor, and the Chevalier
received a decided negative in the second person.</p>

<p>The Chevalier, however, saw too many solid
charms in the object of his passion to yield the point
so easily. The lady returns to London, and lo!
there is the Chevalier. She flees to Paris, and thither
he hies. She hurries to Switzerland, and one morning
as she looks out of the Hospice of St. Bernard,
she is greeted with the Chevalier's most finished
bow of recognition. She walks by the Lake of
Geneva, and her shadow floats upon its waters by
the side of that of her indefatigable adorer. He
watches his opportunity and seizes her hand, muttering
low words of love and adoration; and as a
company of pleasure-seekers to whom they are known
approaches, he raises his voice so as to be heard,
and declares that he will not release the hand until
he receives a promise of its future ownership. Bewildered
and confused, the lady whispers a "Yes,"
and is for the moment set at liberty. No sooner is
she fairly rid of him than she retracts her promise,
and forbids her adorer the house.</p>

<p>She again flies to the Continent to avoid him. He
follows upon her track, bribes couriers and servants
all along her route, and finally manages at Genoa to
get her into a house which he declares to be full of
his dependents. He locks the door, and declares
that marry him she must and shall. She refuses,
and makes an outcry. He seizes her and tries to
<i>soothe</i> her with chloroform. Once more she is frightened
into a consent.</p>

<p>But the Chevalier is now determined to make
assurance doubly sure; and demands a written agreement
to marry him, under penalty of the forfeiture
of half her fortune, in case of refusal. To this the
lady consents: and the ardent admirer leaves the
room to order a carriage to convey her to her hotel.
She seizes the opportunity to make her escape.</p>

<p>On the day following, the adventurous Chevalier
involuntarily makes the acquaintance of the Intendant
of Police, and finds that his "bold stroke for a
wife" is like to entail upon him certain disagreeable
consequences in the shape of abundant opportunity
for reflection, while a compulsory guest of the public
authorities of Genoa.</p>

<p>Ought not the Chevalier <span class="smcap">Wykoff</span> to have been a
Frenchman?</p>

<h2 class="olde" id="Editors_Drawer">Editor's Drawer.</h2>

<p class="drop">The following anecdote of a legal gentleman of
Missouri, was compiled many years ago from a
newspaper of that State. There is a racy freshness
about it that is quite delightful:</p>

<p>Being once opposed to Mr. S&mdash;&mdash;, then lately a
member of Congress, he remarked as follows to the
jury, upon some point of disagreement between them:</p>

<p>"Here my brother S&mdash;&mdash; and I differ materially.
Now this, after all, is very natural. Men seldom see
things in the same light; and they may disagree in
opinion upon the simplest principles of the law, and
that very honestly; while, at the same time, neither,
perhaps, can perceive any earthly reason why they
should. And this is merely because they look at different
sides of the subject, and do not view it in all
its bearings.</p>

<p>"Now, let us suppose, for the sake of illustration,
that a man should come into this court-room, and
boldly assert that my brother S&mdash;&mdash;'s head" (here
he laid his hand very familiarly upon the large
"chuckle-head" of his opponent) "is <i>a squash</i>! I, on
the other hand, should maintain, and perhaps with
equal confidence, that it was <i>a head</i>. Now, here
would be difference&mdash;doubtless an honest difference&mdash;of
opinion. We might argue about it till doom's-day,
and never agree. You often see men arguing
upon subjects just as <i>empty</i> and trifling as this! But
a third person coming in, and looking at the neck and
shoulders that support it, would say at once that I
had reason on my side; for if it was <i>
ot</i> a head, it at
least occupied the <i>place</i> of one: it stood where a head
<i>ought</i> to be!"</p>

<p>All this was uttered in the gravest and most solemn
manner imaginable, and the effect was irresistibly
ludicrous.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Washington Irving, in one of his admirable
sketches of Dutch character, describes an old worthy,
with a long eel-skin queue, a sort of covering that
was "a potent nourisher and strengthener of the
hair." This was in "other times;" and here is a
"Tail" of that remote period:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="stanza">
"A Tale I'll tell of "other times,"<br />
<span class="i2">Because I'm in the mind:</span><br />
You may have seen the tale before,<br />
<span class="i2">I've seen it oft behind.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
"There's no detraction in this tale,<br />
<span class="i2">
or any vile attack,</span><br />
Or slander when 'tis told, although<br />
<span class="i2">It goes behind one's back.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
"Impartial auditors it had,<br />
<span class="i2">Who ne'er began to rail,</span><br />

<a class="pagenum" id="page_705" title="pg 705"></a>

Because there always was an ear<br />
<span class="i2">For both sides of the tale.</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
"But oh, alas! I have forgot,<br />
<span class="i2">I am not in the queue;</span><br />
The tale has just dropped from my head,<br />
<span class="i2">As it was wont to do!"</span></p>

<p>A clergyman in one of our New England villages
once preached a sermon, which one of his auditors
commended.</p>

<p>"Yes," said a gentleman to whom it was mentioned,
"it <i>was</i> a good sermon, but he <i>stole</i> it!"</p>

<p>This was told to the preacher. He resented it, at
once, and called upon his parishioner to retract what
he had said.</p>

<p>"I am not," replied the aggressor, "very apt to retract
any thing I may have said, for I usually weigh
my words before I speak them. But in this instance
I will retract. I said you had stolen the sermon. I
find, however, that I was wrong; for on returning
home, and referring to the book whence I thought it
had been taken, I found it there, word for word!"</p>

<p>The angry clergyman "left the presence," with an
apparent consciousness that he had made very little by
his "motion."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We gave in a late "Drawer" some rather frightful
statistics concerning snuff-takers and tobacco-chewers:
we have now "the honor to present" some curious
characteristics of the kinds of <i>materiel</i> which
have regaled the nostrils of so many persons who
were "up to snuff."</p>

<p>Lundy Foot, the celebrated snuff-manufacturer,
originally kept a small tobacconist's shop at Limerick,
Ireland. One night his house, which was uninsured,
was burnt to the ground. As he contemplated the smoking
ruins on the following morning, in a state bordering
on despair, some of the poor neighbors, groping
among the embers for what they could find, stumbled
upon several canisters of unconsumed but half-baked
snuff, which they tried, and found so grateful to their
noses, that they loaded their waistcoat pockets with
the spoil.</p>

<p>Lundy Foot, roused from his stupor, at length
imitated their example, and took a pinch of his own
property, when he was instantly struck by the superior
pungency and flavor it had acquired from the
great heat to which it had been exposed. Treasuring
up this valuable hint, he took another house in a place
called "Black-Yard," and, preparing a large oven for
the purpose, set diligently about the manufacture of
that high-dried commodity, which soon became widely
known as "Black-Yard Snuff;" a term subsequently
corrupted into the more familiar word, "Blackguard."</p>

<p>Lundy Foot, making his customers pay liberally
through the nose for one of the most "distinguished"
kinds of snuffs in the world, soon raised the price of
his production, took a larger house in the city of Dublin,
and was often heard to say,</p>

<p>"I made a very handsome fortune by being, as I
supposed, utterly ruined!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Somebody has described Laughter as "a faculty
bestowed exclusively upon man," and one which
there is, therefore, a sort of impiety in not exercising
as frequently as we can. One may say, with Titus,
that we have "lost a day," if it shall have passed
without laughing, "An inch of laugh is worth an
ell of moan in any state of the market," says one of
the old English "Fathers." Pilgrims at the shrine
of Mecca consider laughter so essential a part of their
devotion that they call upon their prophet to preserve
them from sad faces.</p>

<p>"Ah!" cried Rabelais, with an honest pride, as
his friends were weeping around his sick bed; "if I
were to die ten times over, I should never make you
cry half so much as I have made you laugh!"</p>

<p>After all, if laughter be genuine, and consequently
a means of innocent enjoyment, <i>can</i> it be inept?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Taylor, an English author, relates in his "Records,"
that having restored to sight a boy who had
been born blind, the lad was perpetually amusing
himself with a hand-glass, calling his own reflection
his "little man," and inquiring why he could make
it do every thing he did, <i>except to shut its eyes</i>. A
French lover, making a present of a mirror to his
mistress, sent with it the following lines:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="stanza">
"This mirror <i>my</i> object of love will unfold,<br />
<span class="i2">Whensoe'er your regard it allures;</span><br />
Oh, would, when I'm gazing, that might behold<br />
<span class="i2">On its surface the object of <i>yours</i>!"</span></p>
</div>

<p>This is very delicate and pretty; but the following
old epigram, on the same subject, is in even a much
finer strain:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="stanza">
"When I revolve this evanescent state,<br />
How fleeting is its form, how short its date;<br />
My being and my stay dependent still<br />
Not on my own, but on another's will:<br />
I ask myself, as I my image view,<br />
Which is the real shadow of the two?"</p>

<p>It is a little singular, but it is true, that scarcely
any native writer has succeeded better in giving what
is termed the true "Yankee dialect," than a foreigner,
an Englishman, Judge Haliburton, of Nova Scotia,
"Sam Slick." Hear him describe a pretty, heartless
bar-maid, whom he met at the "Liner's Hotel, in
Liverpool:"</p>

<p>"What a tall, well-made, handsome piece of furniture
she is, ain't she, though? Look at her hair&mdash;ain't
it neat? And her clothes fit so well, and her
cap is so white, and her complexion so clear, and
she looks so good-natured, and smiles so sweet, it
does one good to look at her. She's a whole team
and a horse to spare, that's a fact. I go and call for
three or four more glasses than I want, every day,
just for the sake of talking to her. She always says,</p>

<p>"'What will you be pleased to have, sir!'</p>

<p>"'Something,' says I, 'that I can't have,' looking
at her pretty mouth&mdash;about the wickedest.</p>

<p>"Well, she laughs, for she knows well enough
what I mean; and she says,</p>

<p>"'Pr'aps you'll have a glass of bitters, sir,' and off
she goes to get it.</p>

<p>"Well, this goes on three or four times a day;
every time the identical same tune, only with variations.
It wasn't a great while afore I was there
agin.</p>

<p>"'What will you be pleased to have, sir?' said she
agin, laughin'.</p>

<p>"'Something I can't git,' says I, a-laughin' too,
and lettin' off sparks from my eyes like a blacksmith's
chimney.</p>

<p>"'You can't tell that till you try,' says she; 'but
you can have your bitters at any rate;' and she goes
agin and draws a glass, and gives it to me.</p>

<p>"Now she's seen <i>you</i> before, and knows you very
well. Just you go to her and see how nicely she'll
curtshy, how pretty she'll smile, and how lady-like
she'll say,</p>

<p>"'How do you do, sir? I hope you are quite
well, sir? Have you just arrived? Here, chamber-maid,
show this gentleman up to Number Two Hundred.
Sorry, sir, we are so full, but to-morrow we
will move you into a better room. Thomas, take up
<a class="pagenum" id="page_706" title="pg 706"></a>
this gentleman's luggage.' And then she'd curtshy
agin, and smile so handsome!</p>

<p>"Don't that look well, now? Do you want any
thing better than that? If you do, you are hard to
please, that's all. But stop a little: don't be in such
an almighty, everlastin' hurry. Think afore you
speak. Go there, agin, see her a-smilin' once more,
and look clust. It's only skin-deep; just on the surface,
like a cat's-paw on the water; it's nothin' but
a rimple like, and no more. Then look cluster still,
and you'll discarn the color of it. You laugh at the
'color' of a smile, but do you <i>watch</i>, and you'll <i>see</i> it.</p>

<p>"Look, <i>
ow</i>; don't you see the color of the shilling
there? It's white, and cold, and silvery: <i>it's a
boughten smile</i>, and a boughten smile, like an artificial
flower, hain't got no sweetness into it. It's like whipt
cream; open your mouth wide; take it all in, and
shut your lips down tight, and it ain't nothin'. It's
only a mouthful of moonshine, a'ter all."</p>

<p>Sam goes on to say that a smile can easily be
counterfeited; but that the eye, rightly regarded,
can not deceive.</p>

<p>"Square, the first railroad that was ever made,
was made by Natur. It runs strait from the heart to
the eye, and it goes so almighty fast it can't be compared
to nothin' but 'iled lightning. The moment
the heart opens its doors, out jumps an emotion,
whips into the car, and offs, like wink, to the eye.
That's the station-house and terminus for the passengers,
and every passenger carries a lantern in his
hand, as bright as an argand lamp; you can see him
ever so far off.</p>

<p>"Look to <i>the eye</i>, Square: if there ain't no lamp
there, no soul leaves the heart that hitch: there ain't
no train runnin', and the station-house is empty.
Smiles can be put on and off, like a wig; sweet expressions
come and go like lights and shades in
natur; the hands will squeeze like a fox-trap; the
body bends most graceful; the ear will be most attentive;
the manner will flatter, so you're enchanted;
and the tongue will lie like the devil: <i>but the
eye never</i>.</p>

<p>"But, Square, there's all sorts of eyes. There's
an onmeanin' eye, and a cold eye; a true eye and a
false eye; a sly eye, a kickin' eye, a passionate eye,
a revengeful eye, a man&oelig;uvring eye, a joyous eye,
and a sad eye; a squintin' eye, and the evil-eye;
and more'n all, the dear little lovin' eye. They must
all be studied to be larnt; but the two important ones
to be known are the true eye and the false eye."</p>

<p>An American writer, somewhat more distinguished
as a philosopher and psychologist than Mr. Slick,
contends that the "practiced eye" may often deceive
the most acute observer, but that there is something
in the play of the lines about the mouth, the shades
of emotion developed by the least change in the expression
of the lips, that defies the strictest self-control.
We leave both theories with the reader.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That was a pleasant story, told of an English
wit, of very pleasant memory, who was no mean
proficient in  "turning the tables" upon an opponent,
when he found himself losing. On one occasion he
was rapidly losing ground in a literary discussion,
when the opposite party exclaimed:</p>

<p>"My good friend, you are not such a rare scholar
as you imagine; you are only an <i>every-day</i> man."</p>

<p>"Well, and you are a <i>week</i> one," replied the other;
who instantly jumped upon the back of a horse-laugh,
and rode victoriously over his prostrate conqueror.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We know not the author of the following lines,
nor how, or at what time, they came to find a place
in the "Drawer;" but there is no reader who will
not pronounce them very touching and beautiful:</p>

<p>That is a good story told of an empty coxcomb,
who, after having engrossed the attention of the company
for some time with himself and his petty ailments,
observed to the celebrated caustic Dr. Parr,
that he could never go out without catching cold in
his head.</p>

<p>"No wonder," said the doctor, rather pettishly;
"you always go out without any thing in it!"</p>

<p>We have heard somewhere of another of the same
stamp, who imagined himself to be a poet, and who
said to "Nat. Lee," whose insane verse was much
in vogue at the time:</p>

<p>"It is not easy to write like a madman, as you do."</p>

<p>"No," was the reply; "but it is very easy to
write like <i>a fool</i>, as <i>you</i> do!"</p>

<p>There was some "method" in the "madness" that
dictated that cutting rejoinder, at any rate.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"I was once a sea-faring man," said an old New
York ship-master one day, to a friend in "The
Swamp," "and my first voyage was to the East Indies.
To keep me from mischief, the mate used to
set me picking oakum, or ripping up an old sail for
'parceling,' as it was called. While engaged one
day at this last employment, it occurred to me that a
small piece of the sail would answer an admirable
<a class="pagenum" id="page_707" title="pg 707"></a>
purpose in mending my duck over-trowsers, as they
were beginning to be rather tender in certain places,
owing, perhaps, to my sitting down so much. I soon
appropriated a small piece, but was detected by the
mate while 'stowing it away.'</p>

<p>"He took it from me, and while he was lecturing
me, the captain, a noble fellow, with a human heart
in his bosom, came on deck, when the whole matter
was laid before him.</p>

<p>"'A&mdash;&mdash;,' said he, 'always <i>ask</i> for what you want;
if it is <i>denied</i> to you, then steal it, if you think proper.'</p>

<p>"I remembered his advice; and in a short time
afterward had another piece of canvas snugly
'stowed away.' I carried it forward, and gave it to
my 'chummy,' an old 'salt,' who had the charge of
my wardrobe (which consisted of six pairs of duck-trowsers,
the same number of red-flannel shirts, a
Scotch woolen cap, and a fine-tooth comb), and performed
my mending.</p>

<p>"The next day I went on deck with a clean pair
of trowsers on, neatly patched. As I was going forward
the captain hailed me:</p>

<p>"'You took that piece of canvas, sir!'</p>

<p>"'Yes, captain,' I replied, 'I <i>did</i>. You yourself
told me to ask, and if I was refused, to do the <i>other</i>
thing. I was refused, and <i>did</i> do the 'other thing.'</p>

<p>"'Well,' rejoined the captain, 'I have no great
objection to your having the canvas, but let me tell
you that you will never make a sailor if you carry
your flying-jib over the stern!'</p>

<p>"My 'chummy,' sewing from the inside, had
'seated' my trowsers with a piece of canvas marked
'F. <span class="smcap">Jib</span>!"'</p>

<p>There used to be quite popular, many years ago,
a species of letter-writing in poetry, in accomplishing
which much ingenuity was tasked and much labor
expended. The ensuing lines are a good example
of this kind of composition by comic writers who
have not sufficiently advanced in joking to get "out
of their <i>letters</i>." The lines were addressed to Miss
Emma Vee, who had a pet jay, of which she was
very fond:</p>

<div class="poem">

"Your jay is fond, which well I know,<br />
<span class="i2">He does S A to prove;</span><br />

<p>The following "<i>Welsh Card of Invitation</i>" is a
very amusing example of the avoidance of pronouns:</p>

<p>"Mr. Walter Morton, and Mrs. Walter Morton,
and Miss Sandys's compliments to Mr. Charles Morgan,
Mrs. Charles Morgan, Miss Charles Morgan,
and the Governess (whose name Mr. Walter Morton,
Mrs. Walter Morton, and Miss Sandys do not recollect),
and Mr. Walter Morton, Mrs. Walter Morton,
and Miss Sandys request the favor of the company
of Mr. Charles Morgan, Mrs. Charles Morgan, Miss
Charles Morgan, and the Governess (whose name
Mr. Walter Morton, Mrs. Walter Morton, and Miss
Sandys do not recollect), to dinner on Monday next.</p>

<p>"<i>Mr. Walter Morton</i>, <i>Mrs. Walter Morton</i>, and
Miss Sandys, beg to inform Mr. Charles Morgan,
Mrs. Charles Morgan, Miss Charles Morgan, and the
Governess (whose name Mr. Walter Morton, Mrs.

that Mr. Walter Morton, Mrs. Walter Morton, and
Miss Sandys can accommodate Mr. Charles Morgan,
Mrs. Charles Morgan, Miss Charles Morgan, and the
Governess (whose name Mr. Walter Morton, Mrs.
Walter Morton, and Miss Sandys do not recollect),
with beds, if remaining through the night is agreeable
to Mr. Charles Morgan, Mrs. Charles Morgan, Miss
Charles Morgan, and the Governess (whose name
Mr. Walter Morton, Mrs. Walter Morton, and Miss

it is on a par with the long legal papers

<p>If you would enjoy a bit of most natural and
felicitous description, read the following by that
classical and witty writer&mdash;no longer, with sorrow
be it spoken, of this world&mdash;the author of "The
American in Paris." The passage has been in the
"Drawer" for many years:</p>

<p>"There is a variety of little trades and industries
which derive their chief means of life from the wants
and luxuries of the street; I mean trades that are
unknown in any other country than Paris. You will
see an individual moving about at all hours of the
night, silent and active, and seizing the smallest bit
of paper in the dark, where you can see nothing;
and with a hook in the end of a stick, picking it up,
and pitching it with amazing dexterity into a basket
tied to his left shoulder; with a cat-like walk, being
every where and nowhere at the same time, stirring
up the rubbish of every nook and gutter of the street,
under your very nose. This is the 'Chiffonier.' He
is a very important individual. He is in matter what
Pythagoras was in mind; and his transformations are
scarcely less curious than those of the Samian sage.
The beau, by his pains, peruses once again his worn-out
dicky or cravat, of a morning, in the 'Magazin
des Modes;' while the politician has his linen breeches
reproduced in the 'Journal des Debats;' and many
a fine lady pours out her soul upon a <i>billet-doux</i> that
was once a dish-cloth. The 'chiffonier' stands at
the head of the little trades, and is looked up to with
envy by the others. He has two coats, and on holidays
wears a chain and quizzing-glass. He rises,
too, like the Paris gentry, when the chickens roost,
and when the lark cheers the morning, goes to bed.</p>

<p>"All the city is divided into districts, and let out
to these 'chiffoniers' by the hour; to one from ten to
eleven, and from eleven to twelve to another, and
so on through the night; so that several get a living
and consideration from the same district. This individual
does justice to the literary compositions of
the day. He crams into his bag indiscriminately the
last vaudeville, the last sermon of the Archbishop,
and the last essay of the Academy.</p>

<p>"Just below the 'chiffonier' is the 'Gratteur.'
This artist scratches the livelong day between the
stones of the pavement for old nails from horses'
shoes, and other bits of iron; always in hope of a
bit of silver, and even perhaps a bit of gold; more
happy in his hope than a hundred others in the possession.
He has a store, or 'magazin,' in the Faubourgs,
where he deposits his ferruginous treasure.
His wife keeps this store, and is a '<i>Marchande de
Fer</i>.' He maintains a family, like another man; one
or two of his sons he brings up to scratch for a living,
and the other he sends to college; and he has a lot
<a class="pagenum" id="page_708" title="pg 708"></a>
'in perpetuity' in P&egrave;re la Chaise. His rank, however,
is inferior to that of the 'chiffonier,' who will
not give him his daughter in marriage, and he don't
ask him to his <i>soir&eacute;es</i>."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A sad and "harrowing" event (after the manner
of "the horrid" poetical school), is recorded in the
subjoined wild "Fragment:"</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="stanza">
"His eye was stern and wild; his cheek<br />
<span class="i2">Was pale and cold as clay;</span><br />

<p class="stanza">
"He mused awhile, but not in doubt;<br />

<p class="stanza">
"He raised on high the glittering blade;<br />

<p>We can recall some half-dozen specimens of this
style of writing; one, at least, of which, from an
erratic American poet, must be familiar to the general
reader.</p>

<h2 class="olde" id="Literary_Notices">Literary Notices.</h2>

<p><i>Memoirs of Margaret Fuller Ossoli.</i> (Published
by Phillips, Sampson, and Co.) The subject of these
volumes has left a reputation for strength and brilliancy
of intellect which, we imagine, will hardly be
justified hereafter by the perusal of her writings.
No one, however, can read this touching tribute to
her memory without perceiving that she was a remarkable
woman. It at once explains the secret
of her success, and of her want of general recognition.
From her early childhood, she displayed a wonderful
precocity of genius. This was stimulated by constant
mental inebriation, produced by the excitements
of an ambitious and ill-judged education. Her girlish
studies were devoted to subjects which demanded
the mature experience of a masculine intellect.
Deprived of the frolic delights of childhood, a woman
in cultivation while young in years, goaded to the
wildest intensity of effort by the urgency of an exacting
parent, and attaining an extraordinary mental
development at the expense of her physical nature,
she must, of course, soon have become the object
of marked attention and wonder&mdash;a prodigy to her
friends, and a mystery to herself. Thus she was
early placed in a false position. She grew up self-involved,
her diseased mind preying on itself, and
the consciousness of her personal importance assumed
a gigantic magnitude, which threatened to
overshadow all healthy manifestations of character.
In this condition, she was accustomed to claim more
than she could give&mdash;more than others were content
to grant. The loftiness of her self-esteem was the
measure of her lavish disdain. Hence, with the exception
of those with whom chance had made her
intimate, she was more formidable than attractive to
the circle of her acquaintance; her presence in society
called forth aversion or terror; as she dispensed
the scathing splendors of her Jove-like lightnings,
rather than the sweet refreshments of womanhood.
But beneath this social despotism, were concealed a
genuine kindliness of nature, a large sympathizing
heart, a singular power of entering into the condition
of others, and a weird magnetic charm which drew
to her closest intimacy the most opposite characters.
She was, moreover, generous and noble to an uncommon
degree, in all the more sacred relations of life;
with a high sense of duty; never shrinking from
sacrifices; a wise and faithful counselor where her
confidence was invoked; absolutely free from every
trait of petty or sordid passion; the very soul of
honor; and with a sense of justice that seemed to
ally her with Eternal Truth.&mdash;In these volumes, she
is left in a great measure to speak for herself. Her
letters and private journals present a transparent
record of her character. The editorial portion, by
R. W. Emerson, James F. Clarke, and W. H. Channing,
is executed with beautiful candor. The most
truthful simplicity graces and fortifies their statements.
With no other aim than to exhibit an honest
portraiture of their friend, they have in no case, that
we can discover, allowed their private feelings to
gain the mastery over their sterner judgments.&mdash;Her
residence in Italy reveals her heroism, devotion, and
womanly tenderness, in a light that would almost
induce the belief, on the part of those who had met
her only in the antagonisms of society, that she had
changed her identity. A profound, mysterious pathos
hovers around her Italian experience, preparing the
reader for the tragic close of a life, which was itself
a tragedy. The description of her last hours presents
a scene of desolation, before which grief can
only bow in mute tears.</p>

<p><i>Charity and its Fruits</i>, by <span class="smcap">Jonathan Edwards</span>,
edited by <span class="smcap">Tryon Edwards</span>. A new work from the
pen of the illustrious Northampton pastor can not
fail to be welcome to the admirers of his profound
and original genius. Combining a rare acuteness
of metaphysical speculation, with a glowing fervor
of religious sentiment, Edwards has called forth the
most expressive eulogiums from the philosophers of
the old world, while his name is still "familiar as a
household word" in the primitive homes of New England.
His character presented a striking union of
intellectual vigor with earnest piety. The childlike
simplicity of his tastes was blended with the refined
subtlety of a medi&aelig;val schoolman. The apostle of
disinterested love, his soul was inspired and thrilled
with contemplating the glories of redemption, and
the triumphs of grace over the ruins of humanity
<a class="pagenum" id="page_709" title="pg 709"></a>
The Lectures contained in this volume are devoted
to his favorite theme. They illustrate the principle
of love as the foundation of the Christian character,
and the expression of reconciliation with the Lord.
In the high standard of duty which they present, in
their deep and comprehensive views of human nature,
and in the force and sweetness of their style,
they compare favorably with the standard productions
of their author, and are certainly not surpassed by
any religious treatise of modern times.</p>

<p>The manuscripts from which these lectures have
been prepared were nearly ready for the press, as
left by the writer. They were afterward placed in
the charge of Dr. Hopkins and Dr. Bellamy, and are
now for the first time given to the public by the present
editor. He justly deserves the gratitude of the
religious world for this valuable gift. (Published by
R. Carter and Brothers).</p>

<p>Harper and Brothers have issued a neat octavo
edition of Sir <span class="smcap">John Richardson's</span> <i>Arctic Searching
Expedition</i>, comprising a copious journal of a boat-voyage
through Rupert's Land and the Arctic Sea,
in search of Sir John Franklin&mdash;a variety of interesting
details concerning the savages of that region&mdash;and
an elaborate treatise on the physical geography
of North America. Sir John Richardson left
Liverpool in March, 1848, and after landing in New
York, proceeded at once to the Saut Ste. Marie,
where he arrived about the last of April. Starting
in a few days from the Saut, he reached the mouth
of the River Winnipeg on the 29th of May, and arrived
at Cumberland House, on the Saskatchewan,
June 13&mdash;a distance of nearly 3000 miles from New
York. His various adventures on the overland route
to Fort Confidence, in 66 degrees of north latitude,
where the winter residence of the party was established,
are related with great minuteness, presenting
a lively picture of the manners of the Indians, and
the physical phenomena of the icy North. The history
of Sir John Franklin's Expedition, and the present
state of the search for that intrepid navigator, is
briefly recorded. With the prevailing interest in
every thing connected with Arctic discovery, this
volume is a most seasonable publication, and will be
read with avidity by our intelligent countrymen.</p>

<p><i>The Future Wealth of America</i>, by <span class="smcap">Francis Bonynge</span>,
is a volume of curious interest, describing
the physical resources of the United States, and the
commercial and agricultural advantages of introducing
several new branches of cultivation. Among
the products enumerated by the author as adapted
to the soil and climate of this country are tea, coffee,
and indigo, the date, the orange, the peach fruit, and
the guava. The work, though written in an enthusiastic
spirit, is filled with practical details, and presents
a variety of useful suggestions in regard to the
conditions of national prosperity. Mr. Bonynge is
familiarly acquainted with the culture of tropical
products, having resided for fourteen years in India
and China. His book is well-deserving the attention
of the American public.</p>

<p>The Twenty-second Part of <span class="smcap">Copland's</span> <i>Dictionary
of Practical Medicine</i> is published by Harper and
Brothers, reaching to the eight hundredth page of
the third volume of the work, and to the commencement
of the letter S. For laymen who have occasion
to refer to a medical work, this Dictionary forms a
valuable book of reference, and may be consulted
with convenience and profit. Its merits are too well
known to the profession to demand comment.</p>

<p><i>A Reel in the Bottle, for Jack in the Doldrums</i>, by
Rev. <span class="smcap">Henry T. Cheever</span>. Modern allegory is a
dangerous species of composition. The taste of the
age demands clearness, brevity, point; it prefers
practical facts to mystic symbols; and, above all,
rejects artificial tamperings with Oriental imagery.
Imitations of the venerable simplicity of the Bible
are always offensive to a correct mind; and scarcely
less so is the ancient form of allegory disguised in
fashionable trappings. The volume now put forth
by Mr. Cheever forms no exception to these remarks.
He has met with but indifferent success, in an attempt
where a perfect triumph would have brought
little credit. The frequent sacrifices of nature and
good taste, which his plan demands, illustrate his
ingenuity at the expense of his judgment. He reminds
us of John Bunyan, whom he takes for his
model, only by contrast. We should as soon expect
a modern Hamlet from Bulwer as a second Pilgrim's
Progress from the present author. (Published by
Charles Scribner.)</p>

<p><i>The Head of the Family</i>, by the gifted author of
"The Ogilvies," forms the One Hundred and Sixty-seventh
number of Harper's "Library of Select
Novels." It is distinguished for the absorbing interest
of its plot, the refinement and beauty of its
characterizations, and its frequent scenes of tenderness
and pathos.</p>

James</i> has been translated by Mrs. H. C. <span class="smcap">Conant</span>,
and published by Lewis Colby. We have before
spoken of the success of Mrs. Conant, as the translator
of Neander. She has accomplished her present
task with equal felicity. Biblical students are
greatly in her debt for introducing them to the acquaintance
of such a profound and sympathizing
interpreter of Holy Writ. Neander wisely avoids
metaphysical subtleties. Nor is he a barren, verbal
critic. He brings a sound, robust common sense to
the exposition of his subject, seeking to detect the
living spirit of the writer, and to reproduce it with
genuine vitality. A new glow breathes over the
sacred page under his cordial, feeling comments,
and we seem to be brought into the most intimate
communion with the inspired writer. It is no small
praise to say of the translator, that she has transferred
this lifesome spirit, to a great degree, into her
own production.</p>

<p>Redfield has published a spirited translation of
<span class="smcap">Arsene Houssaye's</span> work on the <i>Men and Women
of the Eighteenth Century</i> in France. A more characteristic
portraiture of that egotistic and voluptuous
age is not to be found in any language. It places us
in the midst of the frivolous court, where the love
of pleasure had triumphed over natural sentiment,
where religion was lost in hypocrisy, and earnestness
of character laughed out of countenance by
shameless adventurers. The brilliancy of coloring
in these volumes does not disguise the infamy of the
persons whom it celebrates. They are displayed
in all their detestable heartlessness, and present a
wholesome warning to the reader by the hideous
ugliness of their example.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bon Gaultier's</span> <i>Book of Ballads</i>. These clever
parodies and satires, whose cool audacity and mischievous
love of fun have secured them a favorite
place in the English magazines, have been republished
in a neat edition by Redfield. Our too thin-skinned
compatriots may find something to provoke
their ire in the American Ballads, but the sly malice
of these effusions generally finds an antidote in their
absurdity. For the rest, Bon Gaultier may be called,
in Yankee parlance, "a right smart chap," excelling
in a species of literature which the highest genius
rarely attempts.</p>

<p>We have a new edition of <span class="smcap">Walker's</span> <i>Rhyming</i>
<a class="pagenum" id="page_710" title="pg 710"></a>
<i>Dictionary</i> from Lindsay and Blakiston&mdash;a welcome
aid, no doubt, to scribblers in pursuit of rhymes under
difficulties. We hope it will not have the effect
to stimulate the crop of bad poetry, which of late has
been such a nuisance to honest readers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Mitford</span>, in her <i>Literary Recollections</i> gives
some specimens of poetical charades by Mr. Praed,
the most successful composer of lyrical <i>jeux d'esprit</i>
of this kind. In the review of her work by the
<i>Athen&aelig;um</i>, the two following charades are quoted,
the latter of which, Miss Mitford says, is still a mystery
to her, and proposes a solution to her readers:</p>

<h4>I.</h4>

<div class="poem">
<p class="stanza">
"Come from my <i>First</i>, ay, come!<br />
<span class="i2">The battle dawn is nigh;</span><br />
And the screaming trump and the thundering drum<br />
<span class="i2">Are calling thee to die!</span><br />
Fight as thy father fought;<br />
<span class="i2">Fall as thy father fell;</span><br />
Thy task is taught; thy shroud is wrought,<br />
<span class="i2">So; forward and farewell!</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
"Toll ye my <i>Second</i>! toll!<br />
<span class="i2">Fling high the flambeau's light;</span><br />
And sing the hymn for a parted soul<br />
<span class="i2">Beneath the silent night!</span><br />
The wreath upon his head,<br />
<span class="i2">The cross upon his breast,</span><br />
Let the prayer be said, and the tear be shed,<br />
<span class="i2">So,&mdash;take him to his rest!</span></p>
<p class="stanza">
"Call ye my <i>Whole</i>, ay, call,<br />
<span class="i2">The lord of lute and lay;</span><br />
And let him greet the sable pall<br />
<span class="i2">With a noble song to-day;</span><br />
Go, call him by his name!<br />
<span class="i2">
o fitter hand may crave</span><br />
To light the flame of a soldier's fame<br />
<span class="i2">On the turf of a soldier's grave.</span></p>
</div>

<h4>II.</h4>

<div class="poem">
<p class="stanza">
"Sir Hilary charged at Agincourt,&mdash;<br />
<span class="i2">Sooth 'twas an awful day!</span><br />
And though in that old age of sport<br />
The rufflers of the camp and court<br />
<span class="i2">Had little time to pray,</span><br />
'Tis said Sir Hilary muttered there<br />
Two syllables by way of prayer.</p>
<p class="stanza">
"My <i>First</i> to all the brave and proud<br />
<span class="i2">Who see to-morrow's sun;</span><br />
My <i>

To those who find their dewy shroud<br />
<span class="i2">Before to-day's be done;</span><br />
And both together to all blue eyes<br />
That weep when a warrior nobly dies."</p>
</div>

<p>A correspondent of the <i>Literary Gazette</i> furnishes
the following poetical solution of the two charades
in one:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="stanza">
"No more we hear the sentry's heavy tramp<br />
Around the precincts of the drowsy <i>camp</i>;<br />
All now is hush'd in calm and sweet repose,<br />
And peaceful is the lovely evening's close;<br />
Save when the village chimes the hours forth-tell,<br />
Or parting souls demand the passing <i>bell</i>.<br />
Would I could grasp a <i>Campbell's</i> lyric pen!<br />
I then might justice do to 'arms and men,'<br />
And sing the well-fought field of Agincourt,<br />
Where, hand to hand, mix'd in the bloody sport,<br />
The hosts of France, vain of superior might,<br />
By English valor were o'erthrown in fight,<br />
And bade to fame and fortune long <i>Good Night</i>!"</p>

<p>The election of the Greek Professor in the University
of Edinburgh was fixed for the 2d of March.
The number of candidates in the field was very
large, but it was thought that many would retire before
the day of election. The principal struggle was
supposed to be between Dr. William Smith, of New
College, London, the learned author of the Classical
Dictionaries; Dr. Price, late of Rugby, the friend
of Dr. Arnold; Professor Macdowall, of Queen's
College, Belfast; and Professor Blackie, of Aberdeen.
The emoluments of the chair are upward of
800<i>l.</i>, and the college duties extend only over about
half the year, during the winter session from November
to May.</p>

<p>Professor <span class="smcap">Robinson</span>, our townsman, whose proposed
expedition to Palestine we lately announced,
was at Berlin, at the latest accounts, and expects to
be at Beyrout on the 1st of March. He intends to
occupy most of his time in visiting the more remote
districts of the country, and those villages off the
usual routes, which are least known to travelers.
Toward the completion of the topography and geography
of Palestine, we may expect many new facts to
be thus obtained. One of the American missionaries
in Syria, the Rev. <span class="smcap">Eli Smith</span>, and Mr. <span class="smcap">William
Dickson</span>, of Edinburgh, are to join Professor <span class="smcap">Robinson</span>
at Beyrout, and accompany him in the journey.
The identification of the site of the Holy
Sepulchre, about which there has been much dispute
lately, is one object to which special attention will
be given. Dr. Robinson was in London, on his
route to the Continent, and attended the meetings of
the Geographical and other Societies.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The wife of Professor <span class="smcap">Robinson</span> has recently
published a protest in the London <i>Athen&aelig;um</i> against
a garbled English edition of her work on the Colonization
of New England. Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robinson</span> says, "A
work appeared in London last summer with the following
title: 'Talvi's History of the Colonization of
America,' edited by William Hazlitt, in two volumes.
It seems proper to state that the original work was
written under favorable circumstances <i>in German</i>
and published in Germany. It treated only of the
colonization of <i>
ew England</i>:&mdash;and that only stood
on its title-page. The above English publication
therefore, is a mere translation&mdash;and it was made
without the consent or knowledge of the author.
The very title is a misnomer; all references to authorities
are omitted; and the whole work teems
with errors, not only of the press, but also of translation&mdash;the
latter such as could have been made by
no person well acquainted with the German and
English tongues. For the work in this form, therefore,
<a class="pagenum" id="page_711" title="pg 711"></a>
the author can be in no sense whatever responsible."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A late number of the <i>London Leader</i> in a review
of <span class="smcap">Herman Melville's</span> <i>Moby Dick, or the Whale</i>,
says, "Want of originality has long been the just
and standing reproach to American literature; the
best of its writers were but second-hand Englishmen.
Of late some have given evidence of originality;
not <i>absolute</i> originality, but such genuine outcoming
of the American intellect as can be safely
called national. Edgar Poe, Nathaniel Hawthorne,
and Herman Melville are assuredly no British off-shoots;
nor is Emerson&mdash;the <i>German</i> American that
he is! The observer of this commencement of an
American literature, properly so called, will notice
as significant that these writers have a wild and
mystic love of the super-sensual, peculiarly their own.
To move a horror skillfully, with something of the
earnest faith in the Unseen, and with weird imagery
to shape these phantasms so vividly that the most
incredulous mind is hushed, absorbed&mdash;to do this no
European pen has apparently any longer the power&mdash;to
do this American literature is without a rival.
What <i>romance</i> writer can be named with <span class="smcap">Hawthorne</span>?
Who knows the horrors of the seas like
<span class="smcap">Herman Melville</span>?"</p>

<p>A bill has been introduced by the Lord Advocate
for abolishing tests in the Scottish universities for
all professional chairs but those of the theological
faculties. At present every professor, before induction,
is required by law to sign the Westminster
Confession of Faith, and the other formularies of the
Scottish Established Kirk. In many cases the signature
is not actually required, or it is given as a
mere matter of form. Many of the most distinguished
professors in Scotland do not belong to the Established
Church of that country.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Count <span class="smcap">de Montalembert's</span> formal reception as
a Member of the Acad&eacute;mie Fran&ccedil;aise took place on
the 5th of February; and as an event of literary
and political importance, excited extraordinary sensation.
The <i>salle</i> of the Academy was thronged to
excess by the <i>&eacute;lite</i> of Parisian society, and hundreds
who had obtained tickets were unable to secure admission.
As usual on such occasions, the Count delivered
an harangue, the text of which was the merits,
real or supposed, of the deceased member to whose
chair he succeeded&mdash;but the burden of which was an
exposition of the Count's opinions on things political,
and things in general. As usual, also, one of the
Academicians replied by a complimentary discourse to
the new member, and it so chanced that the respondent
was no less a personage than M. Guizot. These
two distinguished men are what the French call
"eagles of eloquence," and under any circumstance
the liveliest interest would have been felt to see the
two noble birds take an oratorical flight; but on this
occasion it was immensely increased, by the fact that
they are recognized chiefs of two different creeds in
religion, the Catholic and the Protestant; of two hostile
political parties, that of absolutism, and that of
liberty; and of two contending schools in philosophy&mdash;one,
which imposes authority on the mind of man, the
other, which maintains his right to free examination.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Cavaignac</span> is stated to be employing the leisure
of his voluntary exile in writing his own memoirs.
This may be one of the mere rumors which float idly
about in an age of interrupted sequence and disturbed
action, but should it prove true, the public may hope
for a curious and exciting narrative from the hero of
June. Godfrey Cavaignac, his brother, was one of
the wittiest and sternest of republican writers under
Louis Philippe&mdash;and his own avowed opinions were
the cause of much suspicion to the government, though
his brilliant exploits in Algiers rendered it impossible
to keep him down. Of course, however, the chief
interest of his memoirs would centre in the pages
devoted to his share in events subsequent to 1848.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A letter-writer from Paris to a London journal,
presents some sound comments on the recent infamous
law for the suppression of the freedom of the
press: "President Bonaparte has this day promulgated
his long-expected law on the press. It is of
unexampled harshness and oppression. Old Draco
himself, if living in these days, would not have made
it so atrociously severe. It ruins newspaper and
periodical proprietors; it strips editors, and writers,
and reporters of the means of obtaining their bread
by their honest industry; it altogether annihilates
the political press. And not content with this, it
prohibits the entrance into France of <i>foreign</i> political
journals and periodicals, without the special authorization
of the government.</p>

<p>"A few months ago the number of daily political
newspapers in Paris exceeded thirty; it now does
not amount to ten, and of these ten some are certain
to disappear in the course of a short time. It is a
very moderate computation to suppose that each one
of the twenty and odd suppressed journals gave regular
employment at good salaries to ten literary men,
as editors, contributors, reporters, correspondents, or
critics, and that each one afforded occasional employment
to at least the same number of feuilletonistes.
Here, then, we have upward of twice two
hundred men, who, as regards intelligence, are of the
<i>&eacute;lite</i> of society, suddenly deprived of 'the means
whereby they lived,' without any fault of their own.
What is to become of them? What of their helpless
wives and families? Few of them have any aptitude
for any other calling, and even if they had, what
chance have they, in this overstocked world, of finding
vacant places? The contemplation of their
misery must wring every heart, and the more so as,
from a certain <i>fiert&eacute;</i> they all possess, they feel it with
peculiar bitterness. But, after all, they are but a
small portion of the unfortunates who are ruined by
the ruining of the press: there are the compositors,
who must exceed two thousand in number; there
are the news-venders, who must amount to hundreds,
there are the distributors, and the publishers, and the
clerks, and all the various dependents of a journal,
who must amount to hundreds more&mdash;all, like Othello,
now exclaiming, 'My occupation's gone.' And
then paper-makers and type-founders must surely
find work slacker and wages lower, now that the
newspapers are dead. And then, again, the caf&eacute;s
and the reading-rooms&mdash;a very legion&mdash;can they do
the same amount of business when they have no
newspapers to offer? I wonder whether the French
Dictator has ever thought of the wide-spread misery
he has occasioned, and is causing, by his enmity to
the press. It may be doubted&mdash;else, perhaps, he
would never, from motives of personal or political
convenience, have annihilated such an important
branch of human industry, which gave bread to tens
of thousands. It is a fine thing to have a giant's
strength, but tyrannous to use it as a giant."</p>

that lady's former novels. The restless longing after
new sensations, and the logicless action of a vain

<p>"Of the language and literature of Hungary," says
the <i>Literary Gazette</i>, "little is known in England.
No European nation has excited so much political
interest, with so little intellectual communion, or
literary intercourse with other nations. By deeds,
very little by words, has Hungary gained the sympathy
and respect of the Anglo-Saxon freemen on both
sides of the Atlantic. Few Englishmen have ever
heard of the names of Garay, and Pet&ouml;fi, and Kisfaludy,
and V&ouml;r&ouml;smartz, whose lyric strains stir the
hearts of the Magyars. The literature of so noble a
people can not remain longer neglected in England.
Besides the political importance which the country
will yet assume, there is beauty and originality in
the language itself deserving study. Of all European
tongues, it has most of the Oriental spirit and
form in its idioms. We are glad to find that an elementary
work, entitled 'The Hungarian Language;
its Structure and Rules, with Exercises and a Vocabulary,'
is in the press, by Sigismund W&eacute;key, late
aid-de-camp to Kossuth. Both in Great Britain and
America, we have little doubt, the book will be popular."</p>

<p>The Edinburgh papers record the death, upon the

Esq., the head of the firm of eminent publishers
of that name. For the last two years the state
of Mr. Blackwood's health compelled his withdrawal
from a business which, for the previous fifteen years,
he had conducted with admirable energy, sagacity,
and success. In the discharge of the difficult duties
which devolved upon him, from his position with
reference to the literary men of the day, Robert
Blackwood uniformly displayed the same strong
practical sense for which his father, the founder of
the Magazine, was distinguished. He was respected
and beloved for his simple and manly qualities
by all who had the happiness to know him. His
judgments were independent, clear, and decided;
his attachments strong and sincere, and by many his
name will be long and warmly remembered as that

French, Italian, and Scandinavian, as well as into
English. The character of the monument can not

<p>Turin journals announce the death of <span class="smcap">Serangeli</span>,
an artist of celebrity. He was born at Rome, in 1770,
and became a pupil of the celebrated David. At an
early age he distinguished himself by a painting in
one of the annual exhibitions at Paris, and commissions
of importance were given to him by the government.
His principal works are: <i>Eurydice dying in
the arms of Orpheus</i>; <i>Orpheus soliciting her release
from the King of Hell</i>; <i>Sophocles pleading against his
Sons</i>; a <i>Christ Crucified</i>; and the <i>Interview of the
Emperors Napoleon and Alexander at Tilsit</i>. Of late
years he confined himself principally to portrait-painting,
and his skill as an historical painter declined in
consequence.

<h3>THOUGHTS ON FRENCH AFFAIRS.</h3>

<p class="center small">(<i>Selected from a Course of Lectures by</i> <span class="smcap">Professor Punch</span>.)</p>

<p>The President has been elected for ten years.
By the time this period has closed, it will be found
that not only the term of the President's power,
but the prosperity of France will be Decade (<i>Decayed</i>).</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Election</span>," according to the Dictionaries, is
a synonym for "Choice.'" But in Louis Napoleon's
new Political Dictionary we find the significant
addendum:&mdash;"'<i>Hobson's' understood</i>."</p>

<p>The two parties in France, who are the one
in favor of a King and the other in favor of a
Commonwealth, are easily distinguished by the
denominations of Monarchists and Republicans;
but there is some difficulty in finding a denomination
for those in favor of an Empire, unless we
adopt that of <i>Empirics</i>.</p>

<p>The President is said to be a firm believer
in the <i>Thompsonian practice</i> of medicine. This is
probable, from the fact that he has treated the
Insurgents with <i>Cayenne</i>.</p>

<p>In honor of the vote for Louis Napoleon "the
Tower of Notre Dame was decorated with hangings."
Considering the origin of the present
government, which is based on so many <i>shootings</i>,
a very appropriate decoration is by means of
<i>hanging</i>.</p>

<p>The French trees of Liberty have been cut
down and the wood given to the poor for fuel.
The only liberty which the French have is&mdash;to
warm themselves.</p>

<p>The French have long been well instructed in
Deportment; the President is now giving them
lessons in Deportation.</p>

<p>France is still quiet; she is taking her little
<i>
ap</i>.</p>

<p>This plate represents the "<span class="smcap">Prince
President</span>" taking possession of the
effects of his deceased Uncle. From
an old chest he has rummaged out the
Imperial globe, crown, eagle, and collar.
The Code Napoleon, a pair of
military boots&mdash;too large to fit the new
owner&mdash;and a bayonet, make up the
remainder of the contents of the chest.
The sceptre is surmounted by an expanded
hand, the thumb of which comes
in suspicious proximity to the nose of
a bust of the Uncle. From an open
closet the Imperial eagle, reduced to
the last state of emaciation, is looking
out. In the fireplace is the Imperial
chair, to which an old hag, who might
pass for the Avenging Nemesis, is setting
fire, probably with the wood of the
Trees of Liberty. Sundry hoards, left
by the former occupant of the house,
have been discovered, from which the
young heir's ghostly attendant is helping
himself. The new tailor, Monsieur
<span class="smcap">Gendarme</span>, is in the act of measuring
the President for a suit of "Imperial
purple, first quality." Mademoiselle
<span class="smcap">Liberte</span>, accompanied by her mother,
Madame <span class="smcap">France</span>, comes to demand
the fulfillment of the promises he has
made her, and has brought the wedding-ring;
but he refuses to fulfill his
solemnly sworn engagement; and offers
money to the mother, who rejects
it with an expression of countenance
that brooks no good to the gay deceiver.
"The characters in this picture," says
Heir <span class="smcap">Sauerteig</span>, "are admirably developed;
the stupid brutality of the heir,
the grief and shame of the poor deceived
<span class="smcap">Liberte</span>, the anger of <span class="smcap">France</span>, which,
it is clear, will not be satisfied with
words, the greed and avarice of the
peculating priest, and the business-like
air of the tailor&mdash;perfectly indifferent
whether he fits his patron with an imperial
robe or a convict's blouse&mdash;are
worthy of the highest admiration."

<h3>THE SEVEN WONDERS OF A YOUNG LADY.</h3>

<h4>I.</h4>

<p>Keeping her accounts in preference to an
Album.</p>

<h4>II.</h4>

<p>Generously praising the attractions of that
"affected creature" who always cut her out.</p>

<h4>III.</h4>

<p>Not ridiculing the man she secretly prefers&mdash;nor
quizzing what she seriously admires.</p>

<h4>IV.</h4>

<p>Not changing her "dear, dear friend" quarterly&mdash;or
her dress three times a day.</p>

<h4>V.</h4>

<p>Reading a novel without looking at the third volume first; or writing a
letter without a post-script; or taking wine at dinner without saying
"the smallest drop in the world;" or singing without "a bad cold;" or
wearing shoes that were not "a mile too big for her."</p>

<h4>VI.</h4>

<p>Seeing a baby without immediately rushing to it and kissing it.</p>

<h4>VII.</h4>

<p>Carrying a large bouquet at an evening party,
and omitting to ask her partner "if he understands
the language of flowers."</p>

</div>

<p class="drop">The sunny days of April, after our long, cold winter, are peculiarly
inviting to promenaders, who have been housed for four months. Fashion,
always on the alert to please, and as prompt in her ministrations, as
the breath of spring to the buds, is unfolding her beauties in the world
of mode, and, within another month will bring forth her creations in
full bloom. In the mean while, new costumes for the drawing room and the
saloon are not wanting. We present our readers this month with a report
of in-door costumes only, but hope to give them something acceptable in
our next, concerning dresses for the carriage and the promenade. The
fabrics and colors suitable for March yet prevail, with few changes.
<a class="pagenum" id="page_720" title="pg 720"></a></p>

<p>The figure on the right (Fig. 1) in our first illustration
exhibits a <span class="smcap">Full Dress Toilet</span>, at once rich,
chaste, and elegant. It is particularly adapted to
youthful matrons, or ladies who may have doubled
their teens without being caught in the noose of
Hymen. The head-dress is very elegant. The parting
of the hair in the middle of the forehead is very
short, and the whole front hair is arranged in small
curls, short in front, and gradually lengthening toward
the sides. A band of pearls goes all round the
head above the curls, and is brought round behind to
hold the back hair.</p>

<p>Dress of antique watered silk, open all the way
down from top of body. The body is cut so as to
form lappets and has no seam at the waist; the lappet,
quite smooth, goes round behind. The skirt is put
on and gathered just under the edge of the lappet.
The trimming of this dress is silk net in puffed <i>bouillonn&eacute;s</i>.
There is some round the body, on the sleeves,
and all down the fore parts of the body and the dress.
The <i>bouillons</i> on the top of the body and sleeves are
confined by pearl loops. A rich brooch of pearls and
diamonds, conceals the junction of the <i>bouill&eacute;s</i> at the
top of the body on the breast. The <i>bouillonn&eacute;s</i> of the
edges of fore part are confined by pearl cords, and at
every other <i>bouillon</i>, the strings of pearls are double
and go from one edge to the other. The body leaving
open a space of two or three inches at the waist,
just shows the bottom of an under-body of white
satin. The under-skirt is satin, embroidered to
represent an apron, with very rich pattern worked
in white silk and with the crochet. Two rows of
Alen&ccedil;on lace decorate each sleeve; a little white
chemisette reaches beyond the body. The silk crochet
embroidery may be replaced by one executed in
silver, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 2.&mdash;Ball Costume.</span>&mdash;The season for balls is
about closing, yet we give another illustration of a
very elegant style: Hair in puffed bands; wreath
of roses, laid so as to follow the curve of the bands,
forming a point in front, and meeting behind in the
back hair. Dress, white satin, covered with embroidered
silk-net, and ornamented with bouquets of
roses. The body is close, plain, and straight at top,
and cut in three pieces in front; the point is long,
the silk-net of sprigged pattern is laid even on the
body, and follows its cut. The satin skirt has hollow
plaits, and the net one is placed over it, so as to puff
a good deal, without following the same plaits as those
in the satin skirt. The effect of this black silk-net
with black flowers over white satin, is very striking.
In the front of the skirt, and from left to right, ten
or eleven bouquets of moss roses and rose-buds are
scattered at random, and this is a most appropriate
occasion to apply Boileau's verse, in which he says,
that "fine disorder is the effect of art." The short
sleeves are puffed a little, and are trimmed with <i>engageantes</i>
of scolloped-edged black blonde.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 3 represents a portion of an elegant <span class="smcap">Dress-toilet</span>.
Over the head is seen the upper part of a
rich <i>sortie de bal</i> of white silk, trimmed with broad
white galloon, watered, rather more than three inches
wide. This galloon is sewed on flat about an inch
from the edge. A galloon of an inch and a half begins
at the waist, and comes, marking the shape of
the breast, to pass over the shoulder, and form a round
at the back. The galloon serves as an ornament, and
it is below that the body of the garment assumes the
fullness for fluting.  A double trimming of white,
worsted gimp, embroidered with white jet, forms a
pelerine. The upper one is raised, like a <i>fanchon</i>, to
cover the top of the head, without muffling the neck
and chin. The bottom is also trimmed with a deep
gimp, gathered, in sowing on. The dress is yellow
<i>moire antique</i>, figured with a lampas pattern, reaching
to the top. In the front, at the middle, by an effect
of white satin, obtained in the manufacture, the imitation
of a beautiful white ribbon is interwoven in
the figured part, beginning at the waist, diverging on
either side as it descends, and running round the
bottom of the skirt. This admirable dress has received
the name of <i>Victoria</i>.</p>

<p>We denominate <span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 4 a
<span class="smcap">Fancy Costume</span> for a little girl, because it has
not been in vogue for the last three-fourths of a century. It
represents the costume of a girl at about the time of our Revolution.</p>

<p>It was the dress, not only of children, but of girls "in their teens."
It must be admitted, we think, that Fashion has not grown wise by age.
In elegant simplicity this costume is far in advance of the flaunting
exhibitions of finery, which little girls of our day often display. We
recommend it to our Bloomer friends, as a practical historical evidence
that their notions are not "new-fangled," but have the consecration of
age, and the sanction of the generation when our good Washington flirted
with the gay belles of Virginia.</p>
